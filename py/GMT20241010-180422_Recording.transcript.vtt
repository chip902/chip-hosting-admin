00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:00.630
Dennis Kelleher: Pull it.

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.070
Lea Howland: Alright. I think we've got everybody. Yeah.

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.360
Dennis Kelleher: Yep.

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.400
Dennis Kelleher: Hello!

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:09.920
Jessi Davidson: If.

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:10.710
Lea Howland: Hello!

7
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.850
Jessi Davidson: Be back in about half an hour.

8
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.469
Dennis Kelleher: Well, miss.

9
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:33.649
Lea Howland: Alright. Thank you for joining today. So we are going to cover our what we call our experiential and digital goals workshop. And really this is meant to be kind of like a middleman conversation between all of the audience workshops we have the executive vision workshop. We had

10
00:00:33.976 --> 00:00:53.279
Lea Howland: and then a few other outputs, including the journey mapping session, which will happen directly right after this. It'll help feed into that conversation. But also the measurement plan that Chris and his team will be working on further down in the engagement. So really kind of just put all the pieces together of what we've heard what we're thinking for the journey flows.

11
00:00:53.552 --> 00:01:07.169
Lea Howland: You know the different needs of content. We'll review that, and then also figure out all right. What's our ideal next step. We've covered that a bit. But understanding, what does that actually look like when we turn it into analytics reporting? So what will we need to start tracking.

12
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:18.733
Lea Howland: and it doesn't have to be super technical. We can just say, like, Hey, we need to ensure that, like the success of this journey is that we're capturing. Form fills here like, that's how we're gonna measure success. And we will also go over

13
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:38.409
Lea Howland: what it is to be successful for this journey, and then what also, we will consider failure for this journey, just to ensure that you know some things work for some companies, but not others. So just want to make sure that we have that all laid out. But before I get started I'm not entirely sure if you've met Chris on the call. I believe you've met Brian. We have Brian listening in, because she will be hosting the next session.

14
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.530
Lea Howland: But Chris.

15
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.880
Lea Howland: want to do a quick

16
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.040
Lea Howland: Hello.

17
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.119
Chris Vo: Yeah, I'll do a quick look. I'm also just.

18
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.850
Dennis Kelleher: Selling microphones.

19
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:46.849
Chris Vo: Was it? Yeah.

20
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:47.970
Lea Howland: Okay. Okay.

21
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:59.959
Chris Vo: Me and me and Jim have met but for the ones that that haven't met me. Hi, I'm Chris. Vo, I'm the associate director of digital analytics. I manage our behavioral analytics team here at valier.

22
00:02:00.463 --> 00:02:05.186
Chris Vo: And I have been running point on this engagement when it comes to

23
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.590
Chris Vo: yeah, behavioral analytics. And considering Cdps.

24
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.519
Dennis Kelleher: Right. Oh, that's.

25
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.280
Lea Howland: Sorry we did have that analytics workshop last week. Oh, it's all blurring together all the time, so.

26
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.349
Dennis Kelleher: That last week.

27
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.530
Lea Howland: Was it last? Was it last week? Okay.

28
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.380
Dennis Kelleher: To almost

29
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.620
Dennis Kelleher: 2 weeks ago.

30
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.860
Dennis Kelleher: anyway, moving forward.

31
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.060
Lea Howland: All right.

32
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.100
Lea Howland: Let me see here. Sorry one second.

33
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.780
Lea Howland: Can you see my screen?

34
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.330
Lea Howland: Yep.

35
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:49.469
Lea Howland: awesome. Alright. Well, this was just to kind of do a quick overview of what we're doing. But again, we're trying to identify the trackable kpis that will be tied to these journeys to ensure success.

36
00:02:49.500 --> 00:03:10.999
Lea Howland: So where I really want to start the conversation today is we haven't shown you exactly what we're thinking of using for the key jobs to be done. And so this is another reason why I have bran on the call, because she put these together, and we've had a few conversations internally. But you haven't seen these, but these really tie together everything that we've talked about, and all of the workshops thus far.

37
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:20.129
Lea Howland: So what we're considering for our top 6 journeys. That will be what we plan out on the website. So you'll see Brianne

38
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:46.649
Lea Howland: share key key areas of these and her journey mapping workshop. But we'll cover at a high level, because obviously, we want to be able to track against these. But what we're thinking is for the 1st one find a product near me. So this is users really looking for, like a C store or car near them that fits their specific needs. So again, like very straightforward like they are Googling like, where's a half years near me? Or they go to the site and try to find a location near them.

39
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.670
Lea Howland: Oh, someone's joined.

40
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.539
Dennis Kelleher: It's me. I'm just getting up so I can read it easier on my computer.

41
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:53.839
Lea Howland: No, you're totally fine.

42
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.630
Dennis Kelleher: You make that screen bigger than this? Oh, I'm sorry I should have done that. Probably help.

43
00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.740
Dennis Kelleher: Oh.

44
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.359
Dennis Kelleher: he's gonna see what he's done.

45
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.129
Lea Howland: I don't know if I can zoom.

46
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.490
Dennis Kelleher: No, you're good. No, you're good.

47
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:07.730
Lea Howland: Okay, okay.

48
00:04:08.276 --> 00:04:29.173
Lea Howland: the next one being evaluate residential hops offerings. So this is for prospects or current customers, really just looking to understand everything when it comes to your delivery services. Maybe maintenance services, installation services, explore educational content and really determine if they want to make a purchase or work with half nurse

49
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:45.850
Lea Howland: the next one is actually ordering the hop service or delivery. So at this point the user has already determined to make their 1st oil purchase. This might be a recurring purchaser or prospect customer. And they've already done their homework, and they're looking to make that action on the site or understand how to do so.

50
00:04:46.785 --> 00:05:10.160
Lea Howland: The 4th one being learn about more about half nurse. This is all audiences we've talked about creating content or an area on the site that helps everybody understand your values. What services you have to offer again, what it, what it means with your community offerings and anything that somebody needs to understand like, what is hafners outside of? Just like, okay, I want to work with you guys. And then.

51
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:18.819
Dennis Kelleher: Real real, quick question. Before we jump off this, we have a foundation that we run. It's called the Kicks Foundation.

52
00:05:19.234 --> 00:05:22.770
Dennis Kelleher: To me that would be a subset that comes off of this

53
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.970
Dennis Kelleher: and have its own

54
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.440
Dennis Kelleher: world to build. Ikf, if you just want to do it for

55
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.160
Dennis Kelleher: yeah.

56
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:41.859
Dennis Kelleher: ikf, I mean, that's where we we it. It ties into the values piece. But it then it really, here's what are the actions that we're doing and how we're reaching out to communities.

57
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.920
Lea Howland: Love that

58
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:59.600
Lea Howland: and that kind of leads into a little bit of like finding a new job. So some of this is supporting content for finding a new job, but we'll also have additional content in that journey as well. But really, this is a user looking to understand more about halfners why they want to work. There are the jobs available and the benefits associated.

59
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:12.919
Lea Howland: And then, lastly, that commercial offering, so evaluating commercial hops, offering. So if a user or business is looking to understand what you provide your delivery services, what types of fuel fuel you offer, what industries you support, testimonials.

60
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:21.520
Lea Howland: etc. So I do want to pause there and give you guys to kind of guys some time to digest what we are considering. The key journeys.

61
00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:26.300
Lea Howland: any thoughts or 1st considerations about what we have here.

62
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.080
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah, this is great. Thank you. Where would

63
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.499
Dennis Kelleher: ordering a car wash membership fall into these categories.

64
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:46.110
Lea Howland: I would say, under evaluate like, learn more about halfners are finding your you. I believe we're considering. Oh, Brandon, site.

65
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:53.329
BreAnn Kopcza: Yeah, we we when we talk through the car, this fine product near me. We talked about the lead

66
00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.849
BreAnn Kopcza: we use car wash as the example, knowing that it's 1 of the more complex

67
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.580
BreAnn Kopcza: versions of this, right? Like

68
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:09.829
BreAnn Kopcza: the like, there could be a very simply someone's just looking for a particular product, and they might not need to get much information from the site. But

69
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.430
BreAnn Kopcza: Car Wash has a number of different.

70
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:23.550
BreAnn Kopcza: maybe some additional steps with the membership involved. So that's actually the example we use in this 1st in this journey here, that's listed as fine product near me.

71
00:07:24.472 --> 00:07:29.959
BreAnn Kopcza: And and talk through where that yeah, getting people familiar with the the car wash membership

72
00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:30.670
BreAnn Kopcza: option.

73
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.449
Dennis Kelleher: Well, and I think I think it's

74
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:38.220
Dennis Kelleher: Bria again. I think, as we delve more into getting more to specific

75
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:49.709
Dennis Kelleher: specifics around what our C store offers. And as we get to being able to order online, pick up in store from a food perspective or anything else in the future state, right.

76
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:54.309
Dennis Kelleher: we would still all consider that under, you know, find X near me.

77
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.640
BreAnn Kopcza: Yeah, for sure.

78
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.880
Dennis Kelleher: Celsius find Coca-cola near me. I'm making it up.

79
00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:02.790
Dennis Kelleher: We're gonna start tapping into some of those keywords of brands that we sell a lot of.

80
00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:03.900
BreAnn Kopcza: Hmm.

81
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.409
Dennis Kelleher: Okay, just wanna make sure we're all speaking the same.

82
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:16.690
BreAnn Kopcza: Yeah, definitely. And we can talk through this in our our next conversation. I know it seems maybe seems like a little out of order some of the parts of the conversation. But I think we

83
00:08:17.369 --> 00:08:22.800
BreAnn Kopcza: yeah, because we wanted to keep it high level enough that it's applicable to yeah, a lot.

84
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.330
Dennis Kelleher: Any problem.

85
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:35.109
BreAnn Kopcza: Scenarios. But yeah, but we but of course, would it be specific in the terms of like identifying the key opportunities through that journey? So, yeah, I definitely want to touch on that more in our next conversation.

86
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.649
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah, no, I agree.

87
00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:41.280
Dennis Kelleher: Hey.

88
00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:58.949
Lea Howland: So we'll start going into each of these different jobs to be done, and I have a handy table here. But I will zoom in in just a second. But really, for each of these different journeys want to go through, I've recapped what what we're trying to solve, for which we just walked through.

89
00:08:59.231 --> 00:09:20.050
Lea Howland: I've already filled in some of the what I want to talk about the valuable content for this job, because we got a lot of that great content from the audience workshops. But then, again, going through, what does success look like? What does failure look like our ideal next step, which we already have some of the information for, and then ideal analytics which I've already taken a stab at as well.

90
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.020
Dennis Kelleher: Maria.

91
00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:23.880
Lea Howland: Oh, go ahead!

92
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.669
Dennis Kelleher: Never mind. Oh, no, go ahead.

93
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:32.249
Dennis Kelleher: I mean, I think, referrals. If you go to the bottom again, I think that's something that we don't really capture today

94
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.730
Dennis Kelleher: under ideal

95
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.859
Dennis Kelleher: ideal. Next step is that it's referrals. Come in there, too.

96
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.530
Dennis Kelleher: Referrals. If we sort of create our own

97
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.220
Dennis Kelleher: affiliate network sports.

98
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:50.490
Lea Howland: That makes sense.

99
00:09:50.500 --> 00:10:15.480
Lea Howland: Yeah, because ideally, we want to figure out alright. So what did it like? We can measure so much on the site. But what is it? What are the actual numbers? What are the actual Kpis that we'll be using to create these measurement plans to understand, you know, set our benchmarks figure out what successes, and then be able to like. Look a year from now. Alright! What's working? What's not working, or even sooner? You know and say, All right, like this journey. We need these Kpis versus the other. So

100
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:16.370
Lea Howland: okay.

101
00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:19.379
Lea Howland: scrolling to the top, I will zoom in, because I know this is.

102
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:19.690
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah.

103
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:27.360
Lea Howland: Oh, I'm sorry. We just moved from Miro to lucid. So I struggle a little bit, still trying to get this to work. There we go

104
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:50.640
Lea Howland: all right. So, starting with finding a product near me that could be a C store or a car wash, or any other food need, or whatever that might be, we throwing together some ideas for ideal content? And this can be content that we already have or content that we want net new. I know we're going through that Raff is with, you know, figuring out like, keep just like, keep delete and modify

105
00:10:50.980 --> 00:11:10.520
Lea Howland: but starting with what we've already talked about. So physical location listing, having a map having an actual page for a physical location, talking about the different services being offered, not just not just gas or car wash, but the food or anything else that you might want to portray for the different locations that membership content membership is spelled wrong.

106
00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:13.781
Lea Howland: There we go. Thank you.

107
00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:38.050
Lea Howland: Promotion. So that could be in store or website promotions that you want to showcase and then outdoor recreation fuel options. So this was seasonal, recreational vehicles. So those Atvs or boats, or whatnot, grill or propane, and then cross promotional content. Anything else that you're thinking of, or that we haven't covered yet that we definitely need for this specific journey.

108
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.320
Lea Howland: I know we went pretty in depth with the audience workshop, so I tried to capture everything from that.

109
00:11:48.320 --> 00:12:04.409
Dennis Kelleher: Let's go through high like, let's start car, wash, are we hitting all the do we want to have the offers in car wash, you know, like ceramic coating and things like that. I don't want to get that specific on that. Some people may be looking for that. You never know

110
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.550
Dennis Kelleher: we have that we have it in all of ours.

111
00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:11.860
Dennis Kelleher: What? I just don't think it's a point of difference. Oh, okay.

112
00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.509
Dennis Kelleher: I don't think anyone I

113
00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:17.980
Dennis Kelleher: would. Google Ceramic Coating Club near me.

114
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.339
Dennis Kelleher: in my opinion. But I could be.

115
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.740
Lea Howland: What is ceramic coating.

116
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.880
Dennis Kelleher: There you go. Thank you. Thank you.

117
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:30.240
Dennis Kelleher: Keeps all the dust and everything.

118
00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:32.139
Lea Howland: That's what it's there.

119
00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:32.905
Lea Howland: Okay.

120
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.370
Lea Howland: Now, I don't.

121
00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:35.400
Dennis Kelleher: I was up for it.

122
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.589
Lea Howland: Meetings every day.

123
00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:43.430
Lea Howland: So yeah, for car washes. So we have offers like locations. I would say memberships.

124
00:12:45.282 --> 00:12:52.480
Dennis Kelleher: Are you looking for feedback from a Kpi standpoint, or like just really, what type of content are we looking.

125
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:58.840
Lea Howland: It can be any type of content, because that's gonna help me understand what you guys find valuable to start tracking. So depending.

126
00:12:58.975 --> 00:12:59.110
Dennis Kelleher: Like.

127
00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:06.108
Lea Howland: Content that we want to create net new, then it's like, all right. So then, for a Kpi would be membership sign ups or

128
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.240
Dennis Kelleher: So that's exactly right. Testimonials, right?

129
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:20.727
Dennis Kelleher: So like I, I think a good way to think of it. And I don't even know if I'm answering or providing the right feedback, but

130
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:42.829
Dennis Kelleher: in our in our current state right now. It's a real struggle to be able to see the attribution of the Kpis through kind of, you know, new new car wash memberships. How much sales are generated, like all of all of those Kpis that tie back into kind of media plans and things like that is definitely a high priority.

131
00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:46.370
Dennis Kelleher: Is that the type of thing you're looking for.

132
00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:53.263
Lea Howland: Yeah, that's what success looks like. So being able to capture attribution. So yeah, all this feedback is super helpful.

133
00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:54.325
Dennis Kelleher: Right.

134
00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:01.389
Dennis Kelleher: This is where we are

135
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.470
Dennis Kelleher: full attribution. We love it

136
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:07.659
Dennis Kelleher: like a real company.

137
00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:09.619
Dennis Kelleher: We, if we have a

138
00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:12.839
Dennis Kelleher: marketing stack that will support all that. Yes.

139
00:14:15.535 --> 00:14:16.150
Dennis Kelleher: okay.

140
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.649
Dennis Kelleher: Offers location memberships, pricing testimonials.

141
00:14:20.579 --> 00:14:32.110
Dennis Kelleher: Is anyone going to be looking for type of car? Wash, do they care about tunnel versus in Bay. Well, yeah, touchless. Some people are definitely specific about touchless. Touchless is a yeah, yeah.

142
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.420
Lea Howland: Type, options.

143
00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.560
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah.

144
00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.789
Lea Howland: What else to call that

145
00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:44.060
Dennis Kelleher: Oh, it is!

146
00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.280
Lea Howland: And then the same thing, for I would say.

147
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.460
Dennis Kelleher: Retail?

148
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:53.689
Dennis Kelleher: Or is it.

149
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:56.190
Lea Howland: So we.

150
00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:00.589
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah, I guess we should separate fuel from retail, shouldn't we? Yeah, we can do it

151
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:02.340
Dennis Kelleher: feels probably easier.

152
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.740
Lea Howland: So.

153
00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:05.419
Dennis Kelleher: Of you.

154
00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.570
Lea Howland: Pricing types.

155
00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:11.919
Dennis Kelleher: Do we want dynamic pricing on this?

156
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.840
Dennis Kelleher: That's gonna be a tough one. That is hard. We'll have to tap into our

157
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:18.010
Dennis Kelleher: pricing system.

158
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:26.190
Dennis Kelleher: Russ is against that, isn't it? Well, that's on the heating. This is on the retail side.

159
00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.580
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah.

160
00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:47.640
Dennis Kelleher: Oh, I think we got ourselves in trouble. Maybe doing that I think it's tough, because if it something goes wrong, it's like, well, you said it was this price, but now you're posting it. This you know what I mean. I feel like this could be a little bit of a yeah common pricing off. No, I don't see that for these same reasons you probably have a guess. It's just too variable can change in the day. Yep, oh, yeah.

161
00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:48.370
Dennis Kelleher: absolutely.

162
00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:49.130
Lea Howland: Well when it comes to.

163
00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:49.990
Dennis Kelleher: Passing out.

164
00:15:51.780 --> 00:16:12.189
Lea Howland: When it comes to pricing in my mind, it's what actions are they taking on the site for us to to understand their experience with the pricing being shown on the site. Is it that they're literally maybe, putting into a search toolbar pricing? Are they going to like comparison chart to understand pricing that you guys offer versus your competitors? Are they going through

165
00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:24.000
Lea Howland: to certain pages? And so being able to track? All right, you know, are they finding the information that you're sharing valuable and taking action in that way. So when it comes to pricing, is it?

166
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:40.053
Lea Howland: you know, I guess in my mind. It's page engagement, but specific page engagement. So are we creating content that supports those different pricing models? Are we? If we have dynamic pricing on the site? Are they interacting with that?

167
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:48.239
Dennis Kelleher: I don't know. Anybody who's looking for pricing, I don't think are going is going to a website. They're going to gas buddy, or even Google will show it for you, you know. So I don't think that's really

168
00:16:49.430 --> 00:17:03.140
Dennis Kelleher: what I don't see. Much engagement. I mean, what I'd rather talk about is our transparent pricing model, I mean transparency through and through in anything that we do. And this covers all the businesses. Transparency reliable.

169
00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.369
Dennis Kelleher: See?

170
00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.460
Dennis Kelleher: Clean, safe. Did you say safe, perfect.

171
00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:18.269
Dennis Kelleher: safe. I think it's probably well lit. You know what I mean. I mean. I don't mean it's getting a little granular on the safe part. I think the image itself illustrate. It's a well lit site, right.

172
00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:40.605
Lea Howland: And I do go into that a little bit on getting to know halfners, because I know you talked about wanting people to know that your bathrooms are always clean, and that you always have that transparency and trust within the store. So I know there are some like core tenants that we want to make sure that we include in the language as well.

173
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:41.540
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah.

174
00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:51.558
Lea Howland: But understanding what success looks like for for this. So we're understanding all right. What behalf behaviors or actions are needed for this journey. So we're saying,

175
00:17:52.300 --> 00:18:13.880
Lea Howland: being able to capture that full lifecycle attribution, being able to easily understand your pricing models, being able to easily make a decision when it comes to which locations, I would say those are pre or to visit. Those are easy successes. Is there anything else that you would consider core successes here visits to the store.

176
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:14.720
Lea Howland: I would.

177
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:16.849
Dennis Kelleher: It's directions or something

178
00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:18.640
Dennis Kelleher: ordering

179
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:25.260
Dennis Kelleher: online, are we not there for phase one, we're not. That's why, no, it's we're not

180
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:31.230
Dennis Kelleher: set up for order online pickup in store. I think that will be there. We need that. It's in the roadmap.

181
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:36.559
Dennis Kelleher: I'm just trying to think

182
00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.940
Dennis Kelleher: retail itself outside of fuel

183
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:41.609
Dennis Kelleher: from a valuable content.

184
00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.739
Dennis Kelleher: Let me switch off for for Qsr.

185
00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:52.860
Dennis Kelleher: Food service business car wash

186
00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:54.560
Dennis Kelleher: reviews.

187
00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.240
Dennis Kelleher: ratings and reviews. That's a good one.

188
00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.790
Dennis Kelleher: Probably more an offsite piece. But.

189
00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:11.469
Lea Howland: And you're that's through like Google, right? There's nowhere on the site. You'd want them to leave a leave, a review.

190
00:19:14.051 --> 00:19:20.600
Dennis Kelleher: Or that's coming to our Facebook

191
00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:24.109
Dennis Kelleher: or social sites. We talked about earlier. Yeah.

192
00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:25.030
Lea Howland: Okay.

193
00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:26.139
Dennis Kelleher: Better

194
00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:28.430
Dennis Kelleher: ever

195
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:36.850
Lea Howland: I would say, purchase

196
00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.110
Lea Howland: propane

197
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.360
Lea Howland: at store.

198
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:41.630
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah.

199
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.640
Dennis Kelleher: yeah, that's cool.

200
00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:47.489
Lea Howland: I would say, sign up for memberships

201
00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:50.819
Lea Howland: or loyalty.

202
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:54.860
Dennis Kelleher: Hopefully eventually. And I think just basically insight. You know, you know.

203
00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:58.610
Dennis Kelleher: conversion inside sales. If we're getting them from the fuel.

204
00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.740
Dennis Kelleher: we've got to get them from the fuel pump into the store.

205
00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.010
Lea Howland: Yeah.

206
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:07.010
Dennis Kelleher: Right that that's where

207
00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:09.260
Dennis Kelleher: that's where the

208
00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:13.650
Dennis Kelleher: greater revenue stream is. Gonna come from this from inside store. So inside sales.

209
00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:27.040
Lea Howland: So what would failure look like on the site for this? So if there's something that you would consider that like, oh, if they're going through this journey, and they leave to go do this. That's not what we want them to do.

210
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:42.698
Lea Howland: So saying, like, they're looking for a location obviously like drop off from the sites an easy one. But say, maybe they call in, or they fill out a form to make a purchase

211
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:44.690
Lea Howland: So

212
00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:56.370
Lea Howland: cause we wanna make sure that we're providing the content in the right way for this journey to ensure that they don't drop off and leave to go somewhere else.

213
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:59.170
Dennis Kelleher: It'll finish a form. Yeah.

214
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:02.749
Lea Howland: But are we wanting them to fill out a form.

215
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:09.020
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah on the car wash side, or even if it's, you know, if we still have the heating form, so they don't finish that either propane or heating oil form.

216
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:11.949
Dennis Kelleher: If we're going that route. Still, yeah.

217
00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:19.729
Lea Howland: But at this point, if they are looking for a in store location, we're not expecting them to fill out a heating form. Correct? So would that be.

218
00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:23.250
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah, that's in the next call there

219
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:27.853
Dennis Kelleher: failures or something that the user can do that you would consider a failure in this journey.

220
00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:40.199
Dennis Kelleher: I mean, the the drop off is just obvious, right? So it's more. You're looking for specifics.

221
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:46.969
Dennis Kelleher: confusion like confuse and drop off, which leads to confusion. To drop off.

222
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:48.710
Lea Howland: And this one might be more.

223
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:53.570
Dennis Kelleher: Lower viewing time, I mean, you know, not being on the site long enough to

224
00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:58.480
Dennis Kelleher: get through the parts that need to get through. I don't know. It's hard to say.

225
00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:05.310
Chris Vo: Drop off like this is a tricky one to think about. But for an example like a a search.

226
00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:10.500
Chris Vo: what's an what's an effective search. Right? It's when you just search once and you find the thing.

227
00:22:10.858 --> 00:22:17.220
Chris Vo: If so, failure could look like. Oh, this person searched, you know, like X amount of times, and you know

228
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:19.270
Chris Vo: then Lincoln.

229
00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:20.780
Dennis Kelleher: The results. Yeah.

230
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:30.890
Chris Vo: Or having to go through like 10 pages of results, you know. But this thinking about failure scenarios is a lot harder than thinking about what a success is.

231
00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:35.340
Dennis Kelleher: Too many clicks. That's yeah, like, user can. Yeah, that's a good one.

232
00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.020
Dennis Kelleher: I mean, right now.

233
00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:45.040
Dennis Kelleher: what's our pain? Point in car wash? Because that's really the only thing.

234
00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.030
Dennis Kelleher: is it one click, 2 click.

235
00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:54.669
Dennis Kelleher: 3 click. We have an automatic response. If we can't get an automatic response back to customer.

236
00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.335
Lea Howland: Okay.

237
00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:03.229
Dennis Kelleher: I find the registration process just confusing in general on the site.

238
00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:07.170
Dennis Kelleher: Oh, for anything you mean. Well, even for car wash.

239
00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:10.700
Dennis Kelleher: So like membership signer drop off.

240
00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:25.050
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah, again. Like, I think that's where I keep coming back, like we could say, drop off, or we could highlight all these different scenarios. But you can see when when is someone just saying, where are they both backing out right? And why, yeah.

241
00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:29.570
Lea Howland: And so.

242
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:31.560
Dennis Kelleher: Optimistic.

243
00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:37.489
Lea Howland: On to the ideal next step which we've already talked about is signing up for that membership. They visit a location

244
00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:45.869
Lea Howland: again. These are success. But also, do we want to consider downloading the app a success or an ideal next step for this part of the journey, or is this too soon?

245
00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:51.609
Dennis Kelleher: You can put in parentheses 2025, because it will be there.

246
00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:52.570
Lea Howland: Okay.

247
00:23:55.340 --> 00:24:05.309
Lea Howland: But I assume these are the 2 key next steps that we want for people. If they're looking for a location, if they're looking for an in store. We want them to sign up, or we want them to visit. There's no other or

248
00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.610
Lea Howland: next steps.

249
00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:11.189
Lea Howland: and there will be more in the other journeys. This one's kind of more straightforward. So

250
00:24:11.786 --> 00:24:14.449
Lea Howland: because it is more of a location search. And then.

251
00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:16.050
Dennis Kelleher: Missing anything from

252
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:18.380
Dennis Kelleher: Leah. Are we missing anything that you're

253
00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.330
Dennis Kelleher: from your perspective? I mean.

254
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.799
Lea Howland: For the ideal next step.

255
00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:32.000
Lea Howland: Well in my mind. So if a user is searching for location, and then they hit your website and they're looking for?

256
00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:53.499
Lea Howland: Okay, one. Where do I go? But also, what am I? What is the offering at that location? I feel like we haven't talked about that a ton, but like what food is there? So we have it in the content. But what action are we wanting to take? I know, in an earlier conversation, we said, Do we want to have, like a Doordash link, or some type of or pre-order form for food? Do we want them to take action there? Do we want them.

257
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:57.911
Dennis Kelleher: That's another 20. What about what about

258
00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:04.490
Dennis Kelleher: Like promotions and stuff like that? I think I'll live up top regardless. Okay.

259
00:25:05.391 --> 00:25:07.519
Dennis Kelleher: meeting link in store.

260
00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:12.129
Dennis Kelleher: So like the 3, like a a week super weedy, but like

261
00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:21.109
Dennis Kelleher: $3 3 Celsius for $5. Like all of those types of things. Those are those things. Once we get the calendar, my hope is is that we can populate

262
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:27.919
Dennis Kelleher: at the top of the retail section. Agree. So should we capture it here, though, or is it not? Even? No.

263
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:29.369
Dennis Kelleher: can capture it.

264
00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:31.610
Lea Howland: Is there any type of

265
00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:38.030
Lea Howland: case where you might have people download coupons, or some type of thing for an in store

266
00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.300
Lea Howland: need.

267
00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.490
Dennis Kelleher: Maybe for maybe for car. Wash

268
00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:42.310
Dennis Kelleher: QR. Code

269
00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.660
Dennis Kelleher: download some QR codes.

270
00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:45.690
Lea Howland: Yeah.

271
00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:54.739
Lea Howland: cause I don't know. Is it by location, the management? Or there is there any case that there might be different stores for different locations, or anything

272
00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:57.010
Lea Howland: locally required.

273
00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:02.610
Dennis Kelleher: I don't think we can do. I don't think we can scan QR codes in our thing

274
00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:15.240
Dennis Kelleher: or the car wash. It's usually a code. No, I mean for for car or for retail. If we gave them a you know something to go to the retail site, we'd have to bar codes. Yeah, whatever it is. Well, QR. Or

275
00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:16.630
Dennis Kelleher: for everyone.

276
00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:20.840
Dennis Kelleher: If they can give us their phone number, we can email them their.

277
00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.620
Dennis Kelleher: we can text them there.

278
00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:25.609
Dennis Kelleher: redeemable, redeemable code. Code.

279
00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:33.039
Dennis Kelleher: That would be good for car wash. That's the way it would be good for car Wash. It'd be good for any of the other branches, too.

280
00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:38.330
Dennis Kelleher: Capture email or phone number at least. Oh, yeah, it is. I think the phone number is easier.

281
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:45.199
Dennis Kelleher: We don't even have a capture email now. So so that is a very obvious one.

282
00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:55.329
Lea Howland: So are we thinking for like capturing email phone number that would be in addition to signing up for the membership? Or is there like a are you wanting them to like sign up for email somewhere?

283
00:26:55.330 --> 00:27:00.612
Dennis Kelleher: I'm just thinking in in just from what we listened to the last yesterday.

284
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:05.673
Dennis Kelleher: What's the the what's the least barrier for someone to get

285
00:27:06.453 --> 00:27:09.270
Dennis Kelleher: onto a promotion. It's probably getting their phone number.

286
00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:13.830
Dennis Kelleher: And then if we could capture their phone number, we could at least then SMS them.

287
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:26.240
Dennis Kelleher: Hey, thanks for this. You decided you wanted to get the 3 for 5, Celsius. I'm you know. Here's your coupon code, at least. Now we're starting to capture some additional data that may not be a full sign up

288
00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:29.130
Dennis Kelleher: sort of a

289
00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:32.139
Dennis Kelleher: A segmented

290
00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:33.430
Dennis Kelleher: sign up.

291
00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:38.530
Dennis Kelleher: We heard that, yeah, which is really a. It's a good idea.

292
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:41.499
Dennis Kelleher: How. So, though, what do you mean by that?

293
00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:47.770
Dennis Kelleher: Because we're capturing just their phone number, not getting their email allowing us to if they opt in for our text messages

294
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.219
Dennis Kelleher: for any promotions, or at least perhaps

295
00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:56.230
Dennis Kelleher: contributing to them getting into store right right or car wash.

296
00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:06.330
Dennis Kelleher: and eventually, to. You know, if we do have a loyalty program, we've collected all the numbers now, right? And we can kind of push that out exactly. Yeah.

297
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.019
Dennis Kelleher: potentially. What's on the app. They get so many points on and promotions through there.

298
00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:19.089
Dennis Kelleher: Email capture SMS for sign ups, right sign up for the latest promotions and half nurse.

299
00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:22.839
Lea Howland: And that's 1 of the easy things like one of the things that we could track. So we have the sign up.

300
00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:23.640
Dennis Kelleher: Exactly.

301
00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:28.869
Lea Howland: The sign ups for SMS. We have location searches. So if they're actually searching certain locations, what's

302
00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.480
Lea Howland: how many per location? Time.

303
00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:32.490
Dennis Kelleher: One page.

304
00:28:32.792 --> 00:28:40.970
Lea Howland: And then referrals which we mentioned earlier. I know we are a halfway through the meeting time, so I am gonna move on to the next one.

305
00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:45.990
Dennis Kelleher: Why do you think we can do this? Why do you guys think we can do this in an hour.

306
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.770
Lea Howland: I know.

307
00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:52.299
Dennis Kelleher: I was thinking that halfway through this I just

308
00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:55.590
Dennis Kelleher: it can't just be us.

309
00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:57.340
Lea Howland: I know, and it's hard.

310
00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:58.210
Chris Vo: It's perfect.

311
00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:05.650
Lea Howland: Because I feel like when we're in person, and have these conversations that flow so easily, and we can like whiteboard in person, and virtually.

312
00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:07.210
Dennis Kelleher: Exactly a little bit more depth.

313
00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:08.030
Lea Howland: Difficult.

314
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:09.700
Chris Vo: I've done a dozen.

315
00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:10.250
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah.

316
00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:12.240
Chris Vo: Or not felt rush at the end.

317
00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:14.490
Dennis Kelleher: Here's what. What did you say.

318
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:18.320
Chris Vo: I've done like a dozen of these. I've never not felt rushed at the end.

319
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:19.165
Dennis Kelleher: Okay.

320
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:22.370
Dennis Kelleher: Me.

321
00:29:22.985 --> 00:29:25.910
Jessi Davidson: That might have been helpful for the person.

322
00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:26.410
Dennis Kelleher: No.

323
00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:27.830
Jessi Davidson: Scheduling this.

324
00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:31.680
Chris Vo: Sorry.

325
00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.479
Dennis Kelleher: Did she jump back on.

326
00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.420
Jessi Davidson: I did.

327
00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:48.810
Lea Howland: Alright. So for the next journey we'll have a few more options when it comes to what we want to track, but evaluating the residential hops offering. So this is very broad, because there's so many different facets to this based on need.

328
00:29:48.850 --> 00:30:06.480
Lea Howland: But again, this is the journey where users looking to learn more about your delivery services, installation, maintenance services which I know is content. We want to build out, explore educational content. So maybe safety information. Or maybe they're a new homeowner, and they've never had to buy fuel before, which would be me, I'd be looking for that type of content

329
00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:24.360
Lea Howland: or you know, determining if they want to contact you for purchase, or maybe understanding how you guys compare to competitors, etc, etc. And so I have a lot of this slide out right here. So again, pricing content program offerings. You have both services overview educational materials.

330
00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:32.209
Lea Howland: Delivery map. Which do we want to make that interactive or just still have an image. So again, that's something we could capture. For people are interacting with something

331
00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:39.760
Lea Howland: process collateral. So how to work with you guys, competitor, comparison, content, and then installation, repair support options.

332
00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:42.750
Dennis Kelleher: We already have the delivery map options we like.

333
00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:45.610
Dennis Kelleher: So you can see where your driver is.

334
00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:48.149
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah, that'd be cool, just like uber

335
00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:55.929
Dennis Kelleher: right license plate. This is, this is steep. This is Jim D. Coming to deliver your fuel today.

336
00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:58.330
Dennis Kelleher: This is what he looks like.

337
00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:00.835
Dennis Kelleher: Policy is a problem.

338
00:31:04.904 --> 00:31:10.210
Lea Howland: Is there any other content off the top of your head that you think I'm missing right here?

339
00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:16.039
Dennis Kelleher: It says home only.

340
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:20.089
Lea Howland: Yeah, this is residential, only we have the commercial and separate.

341
00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:22.050
Dennis Kelleher: Telling Sebastian just because he

342
00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:25.910
Dennis Kelleher: he's been working on stuff program offerings, full service

343
00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:38.109
Dennis Kelleher: rely. I mean, it's about reliable reliability. We come out during

344
00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.899
Dennis Kelleher: whatever Mother Nature throws us. That's right.

345
00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:43.130
Dennis Kelleher: or maybe not. Milton

346
00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:45.899
Dennis Kelleher: trust enterprise, business.

347
00:31:49.490 --> 00:32:04.899
Dennis Kelleher: right? We want to lean into some of those things that allow us to differentiate small mom and pops that testimonials, testimonials. That's kind of we're mirroring exactly the retail side. But I mean, it's good, though. I said this. Yeah, it should be the same way. Yeah.

348
00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:09.290
Dennis Kelleher: Yup, you gotta gain that trust all the way through. So it's trust through and through.

349
00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.370
Dennis Kelleher: Power. Wash, what?

350
00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:14.790
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah.

351
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:20.829
Dennis Kelleher: community? Well, I I guess it's can we start targeting if we're doing some community efforts.

352
00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:23.450
Lea Howland: And that would be.

353
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:31.029
Lea Howland: And I do have community content under the learning about halfner section. So this is the content that they need to understand.

354
00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:32.380
Dennis Kelleher: Over to it. Yeah.

355
00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:39.803
Lea Howland: Yeah, they're your your actual services and what they would need for their home, or maybe how to contact you guys.

356
00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.620
Dennis Kelleher: Did we put in their pricing? Yeah.

357
00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:45.000
Dennis Kelleher: yeah, the top

358
00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.290
Dennis Kelleher: once we have to determine if we're going to do that.

359
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:52.270
Dennis Kelleher: But again, our fair pricing. Nothing's.

360
00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:55.829
Dennis Kelleher: you know, fair pricing model. A transparent yep.

361
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:58.600
Dennis Kelleher: Okay, yeah.

362
00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:59.299
Lea Howland: So I

363
00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:00.790
Lea Howland: Oh, go ahead.

364
00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:02.689
Dennis Kelleher: Nope, go ahead!

365
00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:13.381
Lea Howland: So when we consider success for this, after someone's gone through all this content and ensuring that we have the content in the right way to make them to have them

366
00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:17.429
Lea Howland: make, take action. We want them to

367
00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:35.929
Lea Howland: be able to understand the halfner's value. Be able to understand why you guys are different. That goes through tone of voice. So the language around the trust reliability? But what else would you guys consider success for this? So, I think, making a purchase moving on to the next journey, which is the actual purchase journey.

368
00:33:36.665 --> 00:33:37.360
Lea Howland: But

369
00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:39.060
Lea Howland: decide.

370
00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.100
Dennis Kelleher: So we're separating the 2.

371
00:33:41.040 --> 00:34:07.529
Lea Howland: Yes. So the action, the 1st action, or the sorry. The 1st journey is more of doing the educational research into what you guys offer the different services making that decision, and the second one could be recurring people as well. So people who are just coming to the site directly to make a quick purchase versus people who have already gone through the journey of understanding. Maybe they're their 1st time buyer. Brand you correct me if I'm wrong if I've missed anything in that differentiation.

372
00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:13.510
Dennis Kelleher: That's what I was thinking. Do we have enough here that supports prospects versus existing.

373
00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:18.169
Lea Howland: For understanding the services.

374
00:34:19.409 --> 00:34:20.859
Dennis Kelleher: Understanding the differences

375
00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:25.009
Dennis Kelleher: of what gets shown up, because we did try to say, if you're in Newark.

376
00:34:25.269 --> 00:34:26.027
Dennis Kelleher: one of the

377
00:34:26.339 --> 00:34:34.929
Dennis Kelleher: cause, we do a horrible. We do a horrible job right now with that. Oh, no clicking a box saying existing, or or, you know, new. Are you new? Yeah

378
00:34:35.059 --> 00:34:39.069
Dennis Kelleher: and a half nurse. Right? Right? I mean, I feel like we should have something that this is like. If

379
00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:54.659
Dennis Kelleher: if you want to learn more about Halfner's, here's your email address and phone number, and we'll get you know what I mean, kind of collecting that information again. I think a lot of people are hesitant to sit there, and they don't know enough about it. We would bounce them to the about, and then we've got to get them back to the order

380
00:34:55.549 --> 00:35:00.549
Dennis Kelleher: in my perspective. Because if I'm gonna do, I'm gonna like, what is what is half knows about never heard of them.

381
00:35:00.879 --> 00:35:04.119
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah. Okay. Oh, my God, they look like there's me in the space

382
00:35:04.179 --> 00:35:08.169
Dennis Kelleher: right. They're gonna keep me safe da da da da da.

383
00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:35.857
Lea Howland: There can be certain ways that we portray that content on the page without having to jump them around the about to the about section just determining like, do we want to do it? Based on industry, for instance, for the commercial pages, like having some of the testimonials there, or you know what makes hackers different? But ensuring that we're not duplicating the content. I know in some areas on the site like we have safety information that's duplicate across the navigation. So just ensuring that it's more of

384
00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:48.269
Lea Howland: You know how we portray that in in the right way. So I'm thinking for success here. We understand the value we they decide to make a purchase. I would say. Success is

385
00:35:49.410 --> 00:36:13.080
Lea Howland: reaching out to your customer service department if needed. For more information. But I would assume that we'd want them to come more informed. So rather than people cold calling into your Service Department. They already have a lot of the information they need, and so they have more direct questions. I would say, success here is understanding how to work with you guys. So it's more direct methods of purchase

386
00:36:13.452 --> 00:36:20.147
Lea Howland: understanding that like, they could use the app, for instance, rather than having to worry about certain other areas.

387
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:53.210
BreAnn Kopcza: Do we? Actually, I have a question there, because I remember us talking about this from a commercial standpoint that, like we want, we want more people to to contact halfners in general. And it it's not necessarily a concern that they're as informed as they can be. We really just want people to indicate interest. So to some. So so to some degree like, yes, Leah's right. But I think I'm trying to. I'm trying to think about like

388
00:36:53.520 --> 00:37:02.559
BreAnn Kopcza: in the grand scheme of things like, what's the biggest challenge we're trying to solve here? Is it like we just want more people to reach out and get in that pipeline

389
00:37:03.011 --> 00:37:04.659
BreAnn Kopcza: because then it's like.

390
00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:05.270
Dennis Kelleher: No!

391
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:06.340
Dennis Kelleher: Oh.

392
00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:07.000
BreAnn Kopcza: Go ahead!

393
00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:13.189
Dennis Kelleher: No, you're right, I think at the end of the day it's it's generating. More leads to the sales team.

394
00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:38.699
Dennis Kelleher: Well, no, this isn't sales team. Well, I guess that's what I was trying to get. Is that the next one, or is it this one sales team is for commercial support team. Well, right? Right? If it's not sales goes to customer service. Yeah, exactly. So we're still generating leads. You're right. We're doing that. I think it goes in both parts. Yeah. And we, we have to be cognizant that we have a lot more locations of pops, consumers.

395
00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:40.630
Dennis Kelleher: tech stores

396
00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:42.909
Dennis Kelleher: to help fulfill and cross pollinate.

397
00:37:45.320 --> 00:38:03.510
Dennis Kelleher: So when I look at our hops and our stores, we can reach some a lot of our we've got, I mean, we're starting to grow in areas where we're not going to have retail. Correct, correct? Yes, that we don't. Currently, we're not distributing there. So that's true.

398
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:11.280
Dennis Kelleher: We're gonna have to be cognizant of. I I guess it'll be. Where's my closest halfner store near me?

399
00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.801
Dennis Kelleher: It's 25 miles away.

400
00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:26.017
Lea Howland: So what would we consider failure for this journey? Let's say, confusion around the service offerings.

401
00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.120
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah.

402
00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:33.519
Lea Howland: Can showcase as like

403
00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:38.160
Lea Howland: frustration clicks on the site or drop offs from certain pages.

404
00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:51.829
Dennis Kelleher: I guess I look at this. Anybody who comes to this part of the page should just read should be able to read it. Look and go. I want to be put. I want to be

405
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.789
Dennis Kelleher: part of this company. You know what I mean. Like I want to be. I want to be. I I want my services to come from there.

406
00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:13.750
Dennis Kelleher: So whether I'm heating or whatever it is, you know. So yes, exactly on a difference, yeah, beyond price should be. Yes, exactly. It should be convincing enough to be like, hey? So to me, failures like anybody who drop. I know it's unrealistic, but anybody who decides not to go with us. That's a failure to me. That's the drop off. Yeah.

407
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:17.949
Dennis Kelleher: Well, or what are we learning, or how many times does it need to take?

408
00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:37.109
Dennis Kelleher: Cause? It might be. I mean, it's a decision people are throwing at us a lot of money. So I don't think we're always going to be one hit one, or they're gonna be bouncing back and forth doing their own homework and saying, You know what I'm gonna go back to half nurse right? Or do we have the opportunity to say, Hey, we recognize you've been in our site. Boom!

409
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:42.214
Lea Howland: A returning visitor.

410
00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:53.389
Dennis Kelleher: Correct, returning. Welcome back! Hey! Where are you going? The welcome back scenario. Did you forget something also thinking of that? Obviously you didn't want to stay warm this winter. Sorry. What's the matter with you? No.

411
00:39:54.580 --> 00:40:08.921
Lea Howland: I would also say, success here might also moving back up. Is signing up for email. I know we've considered some type of email push in the future, or growing that you know chain.

412
00:40:09.922 --> 00:40:15.339
Dennis Kelleher: Think that's across the board. See theme across? All

413
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:21.208
Dennis Kelleher: the ones can go right down the line, don't they?

414
00:40:22.017 --> 00:40:27.980
Dennis Kelleher: And the reality is we're gonna have to segment and have commercial emails. Now that

415
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:34.879
Dennis Kelleher: once once we're to categorize for the segmentation.

416
00:40:36.800 --> 00:41:06.760
Lea Howland: So when that turns into actionable things that we want them to do on the site which will turn into a report, so form fills are calling in for a way to contact portal login is a good way to measure if they've made a decision here. And then also, I wasn't sure. I know. Part of this is the repair installation information that we want to share and broaden that out quite a bit. Is there a certain process we wanna have as that flow? Are we trying to have them call into a different number, fill out a different form.

417
00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:36.769
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah, I don't know if it's like a separate download or something, maybe that they click on, that we can measure, or something we never going to be in a place where it's just be able to order and like, order your oil ideally. We'd love to get them over to an app or to the portal like. That's the ideal. The problem is, we have so many will call customers that just aren't into that. You know, we have such legacy customers. Shouldn't we want to at least have that for the future? Oh, totally. Yeah, yeah. I agree. I'm not disagreeing with you. It's just when do we cut off and say, Hey, those who are not gonna do that?

418
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:38.000
Dennis Kelleher: Sorry.

419
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:40.399
Dennis Kelleher: you know, they're not gonna just say in the portal.

420
00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:58.329
Lea Howland: Those that are looking to get, perhaps some type of maintenance repair, or maybe an outdoor heating source that they have or Hvac system. How do we want them to engage with the site we want them to call in? Is there a form that we wanna consider.

421
00:41:58.330 --> 00:41:59.140
Dennis Kelleher: Surely

422
00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:04.149
Dennis Kelleher: so sorry to back up before we go there.

423
00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:21.580
Dennis Kelleher: So all at the end of the day we want. We don't want people to be ordering online and just having that more of like a convenience convenience factor. Because we're saying that's the easiest way for them to manage it over there.

424
00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:28.699
Dennis Kelleher: everything going through the portal. They do it very manually in my fuel portal. Yeah, the my fuel portal ultimately. That's where we'd like to everyone to be.

425
00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:36.430
Dennis Kelleher: But right now people filling out form is a very manual task for them. But if it gets filled out, can't we? Can't we pop up, you know

426
00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:43.579
Dennis Kelleher: whether it's the usual ios or android to get to our fuel portal

427
00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:54.719
Dennis Kelleher: for easier access? Of course. Yeah, I I guess I'm just fundamentally just like, don't we want them to be able to come here and just do what they want to do? Yeah, which ultimately is the order

428
00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:56.309
Dennis Kelleher: fuel, right?

429
00:42:56.590 --> 00:43:22.189
Dennis Kelleher: A lot of our services are like, call us, call us, call us like form. Fill, call in for me personally. I want to just be able to go there and do it. I don't want to talk to anyone, nobody. But if you're a new customer you may have to, because things have to be ordered. You have to get your tanks checked and things like that. That's that's what I'm saying. So there is a reason to have that right. I'm just saying we're not capturing actual unless I'm not reading it correctly.

430
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:45.140
Lea Howland: This also isn't deciding the final. What that experience is gonna look like on the site. We haven't completely designed that out yet. I know we've kind of gone back and forth. And if we want, we want to have a form, or we want to force people into a portal login to be able to fill out a form, or, you know, cutting off people's ability to like fill out like a Pdf. And send an effect like, I know there's so many different methods of like what we're trying to change here.

431
00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:45.690
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah.

432
00:43:45.953 --> 00:44:05.970
Lea Howland: This isn't deciding that experience. This is more of like, all right. This the form bill could be an email sign up or having them sign up to be able to access the portal. Not necessarily the current form that we have here. So I'm just trying to think of. You know what are the actions that we want to measure? And you know I'm not saying that this is going to keep the

433
00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:11.471
Lea Howland: the process the same as we have. Now, that will change. I'm assuming

434
00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:15.329
Dennis Kelleher: Let me ask a question. This is probably more, for Dennis is.

435
00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:18.899
Dennis Kelleher: could we get to a point where, if people are doing will call

436
00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:28.390
Dennis Kelleher: could they come in and just sign up, and they know their gallons, and they put in their credit card and we fill it. That's what I'm asking?

437
00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:38.669
Dennis Kelleher: No, because people still pay with checks, and we allow them to pay with checks future state. I'm not saying getting rid of anything. I'm just talking future state. Could I go on there?

438
00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:44.890
Dennis Kelleher: And I populate my credit card in there and say how many gals you need?

439
00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:57.609
Dennis Kelleher: I need between 9 and 100 100. And whatever it is, we essentially have that for the, for the portal, for people who are signed up for the portal we have that they can go in and order that way and pay their bill that way, and the credit cards on file. Why would we not want it on here?

440
00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:09.030
Dennis Kelleher: We could have it on. There. Just be the back end of it, though, you know you're just accessing the portal. That's how they do it now, though. So they go into the portal. Now they can log in, and they get their portal, and they get their account and everything.

441
00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:21.510
Dennis Kelleher: Janet Reese and I never ordered from half nurse, and I'm gonna be here for the winter, and I want to fill it up. And I want half nurse. I've heard amazing things about it. Can I go in there, Janet Reese? My address? Blah blah!

442
00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:31.860
Dennis Kelleher: Order it right then and there, and put a credit card in and be done? No, for 2 reasons is because someone's gonna have to contact you because they have to inspect your tax.

443
00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:41.080
Dennis Kelleher: So that has to be part of the process that we illustrate up top, too. Yeah, right? I think we have that in there, though we have that we have that in one of the things there, the process.

444
00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:58.779
Dennis Kelleher: and the other thing is in order to become a portal login. So if you're a new customer, if you're a new customer, there's a lot of steps that have to be taken. What about customer existing customer? You can go in there, and you can put in your gallons and stuff on the form, or you can use the portal.

445
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.359
Dennis Kelleher: so you can do that.

446
00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:09.500
Dennis Kelleher: That's the they may ask how many in your tank now? So they know what to bring to you. You know there's a few questions that they have to ask, right? So just because of the nature of the

447
00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:28.609
Dennis Kelleher: of the product that we deliver. We can't. Just. It's not like, I'm calling Amazon saying, Hey, can you? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Unfortunately, right for existing customers it can be, though, if I'm kind of yeah. But you have to fill in a couple of things. I want to know just a few other things, how much is in the tank right now. And they, you know. So and the access levels and stuff. So there are just a couple of things you have to do.

448
00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:40.160
Dennis Kelleher: Do. Some people have it on file. So it's okay, you know, that's mostly the Portal people. Yes, and I get it, I guess where I was coming from is for prospects. There's a lot of things that are needed, but once you're in.

449
00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:48.160
Dennis Kelleher: it should just be. If you can want at me personally as a consumer, I want to self manage that? Yeah, right, but not everybody.

450
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:59.329
Dennis Kelleher: So so what we need on this side is the portal signed the log into your portal, which is really log into your loyalty. Membership? Right? Yeah, yeah, more, more or less. Yeah, yeah, yes, exactly. Yep.

451
00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:01.400
Dennis Kelleher: Okay.

452
00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:11.140
Dennis Kelleher: do we have that captured that? We still need that port because we have it. Now, don't we? The fuel portal? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. We're gonna need the port. Yeah. We have it captured here that I need portal login. Yeah.

453
00:47:11.650 --> 00:47:12.289
Lea Howland: So are we

454
00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:20.779
Lea Howland: having everybody, both returning, and new customers have to purchase oil through the portal. Login? Is that where we landed, or is there still.

455
00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:21.230
Dennis Kelleher: It's still.

456
00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:21.650
Lea Howland: Nexus.

457
00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:27.870
Dennis Kelleher: It's still gonna be a contact. There's still a form there's still, unfortunately, still got to be forms. In addition to the portal login.

458
00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:30.599
Lea Howland: But they could go

459
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:33.880
Lea Howland: to purchase oil both ways if they wanted. It's just.

460
00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:34.580
Dennis Kelleher: Yes.

461
00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:35.180
Lea Howland: 2 different.

462
00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:36.109
Dennis Kelleher: It's an option.

463
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:44.799
Dennis Kelleher: Okay? So they can purchase through the form online, or they can go into the portal log in through the portal and purchase their oil

464
00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:48.500
Dennis Kelleher: if they're signed up for the port, right for those who are not.

465
00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:51.600
Dennis Kelleher: which is the majority of our customers, they do it on.

466
00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:54.439
Dennis Kelleher: How do we do it with those automatics

467
00:47:55.330 --> 00:48:14.730
Dennis Kelleher: automatically? Don't have to do anything because we have the. We have the tanks and we deliver when we know it gets low. So we don't do anything for them. Ideally, ideally, you want everybody on auto delivery. That's a big thing about automation that we didn't really add, to make sure we're talking about why automatic matters. Oh, yeah, that's that's definitely a a point from a content perspective. Right?

468
00:48:15.166 --> 00:48:26.073
Dennis Kelleher: Auto delivery. Yeah. Auto delivery. I actually feel like this is all important discussion, though. So this is huge. You want to get more automatic.

469
00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:32.759
Dennis Kelleher: right? We want less. We'll call more automatic and make it easy on you. We have to illustrate why, it's easy.

470
00:48:33.350 --> 00:48:35.180
Dennis Kelleher: You'll never run out right.

471
00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:37.970
Lea Howland: So

472
00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:43.740
Lea Howland: what do we want that experience to look like for people who are looking to get something repaired?

473
00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:46.490
Lea Howland: Are we wanting them to have.

474
00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:47.500
Dennis Kelleher: Totally different.

475
00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:48.720
Dennis Kelleher: I know.

476
00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:49.040
Lea Howland: So.

477
00:48:49.040 --> 00:49:02.619
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah, that's a different use case altogether. We don't have a form for that. That's more of a. It's always been a call in. But we could. But I'm not saying we can't. I'm saying it's always been a call in. That's the current state. It's been some of the newer guys I've used in recent

478
00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:05.659
Dennis Kelleher: monster. When I got the house was like.

479
00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:23.830
Dennis Kelleher: everything was online, maybe. And I think that's probably the way for us to go definitely. That's yeah. And we have to. And that's probably a, and that's a discussion that we probably need to have with hops on how to set that up. They can call in or sign up. Tell us your problem like.

480
00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:28.759
Dennis Kelleher: what equipment is it? What do you think? Yeah, right.

481
00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:35.550
Dennis Kelleher: That's another way to help with leads. If it's urgent, totally right, then you can grab those in

482
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:40.490
Dennis Kelleher: right.

483
00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:50.050
Lea Howland: So actual ways to track. That is, page engagement, education, engagement. When it comes to all the content. Earlier in the list, portal logins form completions

484
00:49:50.438 --> 00:49:57.010
Lea Howland: and then calls to customer service, and I'm assuming we'd probably want to do form completions before and after portal

485
00:49:57.450 --> 00:49:58.700
Lea Howland: to see

486
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.229
Lea Howland: how many people are going to the portal to

487
00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:05.579
Lea Howland: complete those forms versus those who are doing it before login.

488
00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:09.650
Dennis Kelleher: Like, how much is the site driving into the portal.

489
00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:12.130
Dennis Kelleher: Versus portal direct.

490
00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:13.590
Dennis Kelleher: because and.

491
00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:14.779
Lea Howland: In my mind, it would.

492
00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:16.180
Dennis Kelleher: Absolutely. I agree.

493
00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:18.689
Dennis Kelleher: yeah, absolutely. That makes sense.

494
00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:31.469
Lea Howland: Yeah, cause, a future state would ideally having the same experience to be able to complete that action. So you know, if people want to repurchase oil. They they know to always go to the portal login, or, you know, etc, etc.

495
00:50:32.201 --> 00:50:39.369
Lea Howland: Okay, we are 5 min short of time, and we got through 2 of the journeys.

496
00:50:40.090 --> 00:50:41.320
Lea Howland: so

497
00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:44.090
Lea Howland: I.

498
00:50:44.090 --> 00:50:49.379
BreAnn Kopcza: Yeah, I'm I'm throwing it out there that I'm happy to relinquish some user journey time, because

499
00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:52.369
BreAnn Kopcza: it's actually it's actually pretty.

500
00:50:52.750 --> 00:51:01.529
BreAnn Kopcza: But like, like. At least today, we can certainly go over like, what does everything look like in terms of how we've articulated, how we've mapped it out.

501
00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:15.730
BreAnn Kopcza: Some of it, I think, is gonna take like some just individual like, look at the map, and it isn't necessarily helpful to look at it altogether. So I'm just throwing that out there, Leah, you can decide what to do with that.

502
00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:16.420
Dennis Kelleher: Well, in.

503
00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:18.270
BreAnn Kopcza: What you want for your business.

504
00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:26.829
Dennis Kelleher: Well, Leah, the other, the other thing is, you could release this form to us, and we could at least try to self populate as the discussions. Now that we've got a little bit of

505
00:51:27.359 --> 00:51:33.430
Dennis Kelleher: rigor behind us, we're debating here and there. And you guys are listening unless it helps. You guys understand

506
00:51:33.810 --> 00:51:39.490
Dennis Kelleher: sort of the complexity of the business. I don't wanna take away if this is helpful for you as well.

507
00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:40.480
Lea Howland: I.

508
00:51:40.767 --> 00:51:43.932
Jessi Davidson: I just wanna I just wanna add in there, though, like

509
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:58.329
Jessi Davidson: in consideration, if you're new, does this homework understanding when you would have that back to us just because the measurement plan that Chris will be working with with chip on can't start until we have this done.

510
00:51:58.510 --> 00:52:01.930
Jessi Davidson: whereas the journey mapping doesn't have any dependencies on it.

511
00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:09.410
Dennis Kelleher: Let's keep going. I was, gonna say, why don't we just keep cracking with this? You just answered our question.

512
00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:13.980
Dennis Kelleher: but I don't know if Leah's got time. So true.

513
00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:16.269
Lea Howland: I have time. I just.

514
00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:18.879
Jessi Davidson: Leah was on. Leah was on the other call. Anyway.

515
00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:19.650
Lea Howland: Yeah, I was.

516
00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:21.219
Dennis Kelleher: Oh! Oh!

517
00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:21.639
Chris Vo: I don't know.

518
00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:22.720
Dennis Kelleher: There you go!

519
00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:25.139
Jessi Davidson: Yeah, Chris, Chris, is the question.

520
00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:27.980
Chris Vo: I have

521
00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:31.050
Chris Vo: at 3.

522
00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:32.140
Lea Howland: You do.

523
00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:35.829
Jessi Davidson: Do we want to just say, I think we could.

524
00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:38.950
Chris Vo: I mean, we're recording this. I can just watch the last bit.

525
00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:41.230
Lea Howland: Okay.

526
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.450
Lea Howland: do we want to take a quick 5 min break, or just keep going through.

527
00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:51.980
Dennis Kelleher: Let's keep going. Oh, we need a 5 min break.

528
00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:54.570
Lea Howland: Oh, no, I'm fine. I got my water. I'm good.

529
00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:55.810
Lea Howland: Okay.

530
00:52:55.810 --> 00:52:58.419
Jessi Davidson: 8 lunch while y'all were working. So I'm good.

531
00:53:00.013 --> 00:53:01.100
Dennis Kelleher: Thank you.

532
00:53:01.530 --> 00:53:01.950
Lea Howland: R

533
00:53:03.852 --> 00:53:09.890
Lea Howland: we did. We have already started talking about this a little bit. I know we were going back and forth on what the difference is between

534
00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:11.570
Lea Howland: top service.

535
00:53:12.962 --> 00:53:14.560
Lea Howland: So this is.

536
00:53:14.610 --> 00:53:38.320
Lea Howland: I would consider one of the most straightforward journeys. This person has already made a decision on what they want to do, they're either returning or a new customer. So they've decided to make that purchase whether it be go into what we just discussed with the portal again, or fill out a form directly on the site. So the Content really needed for this group is pricing whether that be directly in the navigation like we have it now.

537
00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:58.229
Lea Howland: or some form of a page to showcase different pricing options, whether that be dynamic and then I already had in here that new form process which we were just talking about. So what does that new form process look like? Whether it be pre populated if they're a returning user in some way, so they don't have to refill out their say, their address or whatnot

538
00:53:58.625 --> 00:54:13.249
Lea Howland: or just pushing them to the portal login. But I would consider that those kind of the key OP. Needs for this this consideration. Anything else that you guys would consider core needs for this journey.

539
00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:16.010
Dennis Kelleher: I think it's a

540
00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:18.959
Dennis Kelleher: like a welcome to the family like.

541
00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:21.580
Dennis Kelleher: yeah. Boom, welcome. Thank

542
00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.299
Dennis Kelleher: thank you for joining Hafner's welcome to the family.

543
00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:27.410
Dennis Kelleher: because they're making a commitment right?

544
00:54:28.170 --> 00:54:34.119
Dennis Kelleher: And we want to try to start retaining them and engaging them in a way that says we would see them absolutely.

545
00:54:34.350 --> 00:54:36.560
Lea Howland: Like a post purchase email is what you're thinking

546
00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:38.800
Lea Howland: are actually on the site.

547
00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:42.295
Dennis Kelleher: It could be

548
00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:53.149
Dennis Kelleher: combination of the 2. Here's our commitment to you. Yeah, here's our commitment to you.

549
00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:57.594
Dennis Kelleher: The donkey's kicking its legs up the whole time. I don't know whatever

550
00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:00.652
Dennis Kelleher: I don't know.

551
00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:05.119
Lea Howland: Like a success. Page after purchase, like with.

552
00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:11.149
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah, you know, it's a. It is a pretty big commitment. Yeah.

553
00:55:13.590 --> 00:55:15.389
Lea Howland: So for success here, I would say.

554
00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:17.060
Dennis Kelleher: Car wash you send them a car wash, too.

555
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:35.189
Dennis Kelleher: So yeah, let's just saying we could send them a free car wash if they're within a car wash area, we would send them a free car, wash or 20 cents off gallon gas, you know. We could send them a promotional item to start tying them in right.

556
00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:37.610
Dennis Kelleher: Good catch.

557
00:55:40.050 --> 00:56:02.250
Dennis Kelleher: I think it'd be good to introduce them to other things. We have like service contracts and things like that. So after they've made their oil purchase propane purchase. Yeah. So so when we send them an email, we also offer these things right? So it's given them that whatever it is that we're doing it. Maybe that's more an email side than it is on the yeah, right? But that can all be all automated. And exactly, yeah, it is

558
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:08.850
Dennis Kelleher: again coming back to the consistent themes of email capture and all of that on boarding.

559
00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:14.880
Dennis Kelleher: because the cross promotion is so easy through all that automation.

560
00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:28.182
Dennis Kelleher: I mean, and also I mean, we keep coming back to free car wash. But the end of the day, like, I think, that's super underutilized that we should really, really, because you, you give them one. It's like.

561
00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:36.619
Dennis Kelleher: sign them up for membership. But track before you buy it. Yeah.

562
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:45.090
Dennis Kelleher: is the that could be in store items, too. We could do that as well. Coupons, I mean the the cross promotion is endless.

563
00:56:47.470 --> 00:57:03.999
Lea Howland: So that's kind of what I'm I put down for success. I was listening to what you guys were saying. So for success of this journey they're quickly able to make a purchase new interest and wanting to visit the an actual store or go to the car wash, based on the promotion, perhaps, that they receive and then.

564
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:04.780
Dennis Kelleher: Also.

565
00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:15.049
Lea Howland: Visit cross promotion content on site after purchase. So maybe they purchase their oil, and they're like, let me see what else Hafners has to offer you know, to see what I can do for my home.

566
00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:15.899
Lea Howland: I mean.

567
00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:17.110
Dennis Kelleher: I think it's getting to it.

568
00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:27.789
Dennis Kelleher: A chewy or farmer's dog experience, or something like that have pets or anything right? Right? That's a they're great experience. It's a great place to be right

569
00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:35.495
Dennis Kelleher: and say, Sign up.

570
00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:38.880
Dennis Kelleher: that's some shit we send them.

571
00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:48.842
Lea Howland: So what would we consider failure for this journey? I would say, confusion around, how do you actually purchase at this point?

572
00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:54.700
Lea Howland: I would say difficulty around filling out the forms.

573
00:58:00.690 --> 00:58:01.740
Dennis Kelleher: Remember.

574
00:58:02.170 --> 00:58:03.070
Dennis Kelleher: Oops, that's done.

575
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.109
Lea Howland: I would say, mid form drop off.

576
00:58:08.170 --> 00:58:08.675
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah.

577
00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:11.070
Dennis Kelleher: early, mid late.

578
00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:12.080
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah.

579
00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:13.150
Dennis Kelleher: I.

580
00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:18.540
Lea Howland: I would say, increased calls to customer service around how to purchase.

581
00:58:19.610 --> 00:58:20.378
Dennis Kelleher: That's a good one.

582
00:58:25.110 --> 00:58:27.559
Dennis Kelleher: can't. It? Can't be any worse than it is now.

583
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.799
Dennis Kelleher: I don't know what you're talking about.

584
00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.549
Dennis Kelleher: What do they sell

585
00:58:36.490 --> 00:58:41.399
Dennis Kelleher: increased calls complaints. Anything like that social.

586
00:58:43.850 --> 00:58:45.629
Dennis Kelleher: you know, reviews

587
00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:48.300
Dennis Kelleher: complaints where we have to react to

588
00:58:48.610 --> 00:58:52.089
Dennis Kelleher: so any of them, so that could be on any of the buckets right?

589
00:58:54.766 --> 00:58:57.750
Dennis Kelleher: Very universal as they're going through this.

590
00:58:58.210 --> 00:58:59.900
Dennis Kelleher: all of our stuff.

591
00:59:00.350 --> 00:59:02.219
Dennis Kelleher: Right. They they suck.

592
00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:06.780
Dennis Kelleher: I mean.

593
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:11.499
Dennis Kelleher: well, it's just it gets into communities, and it spreads

594
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:14.610
Dennis Kelleher: absolutely. All it takes is one. You know.

595
00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:18.120
Dennis Kelleher: You know, the government controls, weather

596
00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:22.279
Dennis Kelleher: seeding our Clothes.

597
00:59:24.210 --> 00:59:25.410
Dennis Kelleher: You can read.

598
00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:36.039
Lea Howland: So for the actions that we want to actually measure. So the this is the the buy. Now.

599
00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:37.200
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah.

600
00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:37.940
Lea Howland: Alex.

601
00:59:40.930 --> 00:59:43.140
Dennis Kelleher: Or whatever it says, enroll.

602
00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:45.400
Dennis Kelleher: we'll figure that out.

603
00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:48.170
Lea Howland: I'm close.

604
00:59:48.170 --> 00:59:49.030
Dennis Kelleher: Thank you.

605
00:59:49.410 --> 00:59:50.420
Lea Howland: You're welcome.

606
00:59:52.185 --> 00:59:54.180
Lea Howland: I would say.

607
00:59:56.603 --> 01:00:00.950
Lea Howland: Any any form of like pricing page engagement.

608
01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:07.419
Dennis Kelleher: We can't see the last. We can't see up topic.

609
01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:08.500
Lea Howland: Oh, I'm sorry.

610
01:00:09.806 --> 01:00:13.589
Dennis Kelleher: Feel like, snaps. Okay.

611
01:00:13.590 --> 01:00:19.100
Lea Howland: We're on the ideal next step. So I actually skipped ahead. I was messed up myself.

612
01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:22.340
Lea Howland: So we want them to

613
01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:25.110
Lea Howland: like by now. Oh, my gosh! You guys.

614
01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:27.390
Dennis Kelleher: We're all in the same.

615
01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:28.450
Lea Howland: Together. We're on.

616
01:00:28.450 --> 01:00:30.980
Dennis Kelleher: That's right, that's right. You should do this for 3 h.

617
01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:50.462
Lea Howland: Complete a form. We want them and then, so ideally, this is almost like the ideal end stage is is getting them to actually make that purchase. So after making a purchase, we want them to perhaps engage in other channels.

618
01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:57.310
Lea Howland: We want them to visit the store.

619
01:01:00.010 --> 01:01:10.080
Dennis Kelleher: Call customer service email customers, email submissions. Yeah, we get those a lot. Thank you for. Blah blah, what category you want to get? I totally forgot about hops again.

620
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:14.830
Lea Howland: We are. Yeah, we're on. Make a purchase for residents. So.

621
01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:17.220
Dennis Kelleher: For residential homes. Yeah.

622
01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:22.870
Dennis Kelleher: do we want to steer them towards? Well, I think this is probably gonna be something different, the future state. But towards the portal

623
01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:27.109
Dennis Kelleher: to sign up on the portal. So it makes it easier.

624
01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:30.619
Dennis Kelleher: Success could be portal sign up. Yeah.

625
01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.050
Dennis Kelleher: Do we already have them?

626
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:35.932
Dennis Kelleher: We're very confused.

627
01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:39.020
Lea Howland: Sorry. Sorry. It's okay.

628
01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:40.699
Dennis Kelleher: I was in the bathroom I came back up.

629
01:01:42.030 --> 01:01:47.339
Lea Howland: Oh, we didn't have Portal sign up for success. That is super helpful. And then

630
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:49.639
Lea Howland: or we can measure that.

631
01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:50.630
Dennis Kelleher: Next steps.

632
01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:51.920
Lea Howland: As

633
01:01:52.090 --> 01:01:53.100
Lea Howland: the actual.

634
01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:54.400
Dennis Kelleher: We don't see any of it.

635
01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:56.640
Lea Howland: Sorry I'm not.

636
01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:59.299
BreAnn Kopcza: I'm seeing the sorry I'm missing the app.

637
01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.250
BreAnn Kopcza: did we? Isn't that part of the

638
01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:03.450
BreAnn Kopcza: ideal experience.

639
01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:09.530
Dennis Kelleher: It's the portal. Sorry. That's the portal. Sign up my Google portal app. So yes, it is an app. Yeah. Okay.

640
01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:10.630
BreAnn Kopcza: It could be so.

641
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:11.750
Dennis Kelleher: Fuel, app.

642
01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:15.569
BreAnn Kopcza: Okay, but you don't have to have the app. You could do it.

643
01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:18.510
BreAnn Kopcza: or you could do. Oh, yeah.

644
01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:22.179
Dennis Kelleher: Rather increase it. Kafner's my fuel portal app.

645
01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:24.239
Dennis Kelleher: which is is generic.

646
01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:26.280
Dennis Kelleher: It's really user friendly.

647
01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:32.530
Dennis Kelleher: It's not that bad.

648
01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:33.740
Lea Howland: So to.

649
01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:34.160
Dennis Kelleher: Pleasure, that.

650
01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:39.789
Lea Howland: If we would say portal sign ups I would say portal logins versus calling in.

651
01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:44.149
Lea Howland: I would say, actual purchases.

652
01:02:46.370 --> 01:02:49.160
Dennis Kelleher: Best success? Are we on successes.

653
01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:50.720
Lea Howland: So we.

654
01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:53.890
Dennis Kelleher: We are.

655
01:02:53.890 --> 01:02:54.540
Lea Howland: We're on.

656
01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:55.929
Dennis Kelleher: Those ideal analytics.

657
01:02:55.930 --> 01:03:09.889
Lea Howland: Dealer analytics. So we covered successes. We listed off quickly, being able to make a purchase. New interest in wanting to visit the C store, visit cross promotion content, and then portal sign up app usage, I just added, and then.

658
01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:16.649
Dennis Kelleher: Okay. The one thing I I think we should add, is, they sign up for autumn auto, pay, auto, pay, auto delivery auto delivery.

659
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:17.900
Dennis Kelleher: Sorry.

660
01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:19.080
Lea Howland: You're fine.

661
01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:23.819
Dennis Kelleher: Thought we captured them didn't capture it in the other one. I don't. Yeah.

662
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.939
Dennis Kelleher: actually, you're right. You're right.

663
01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:41.029
Lea Howland: So that, yeah, so this is really meant to be like at at time of purchase, what are we wanting them to do? They've already considered. So does auto pay happen at time of purchase. Yes, so when they're filling out the form.

664
01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.500
Dennis Kelleher: Right. It may end up.

665
01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:47.369
Dennis Kelleher: They get 2 deliveries, and they'll say, screw it. I want to just do auto.

666
01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:48.610
Dennis Kelleher: You know what I mean.

667
01:03:48.610 --> 01:03:49.149
Lea Howland: It's the wind.

668
01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:52.050
Dennis Kelleher: Which is a win. That's future state. Yeah.

669
01:03:54.580 --> 01:04:02.950
Lea Howland: And then, so we have failure looking like confusion around how to make a purchase difficulty filling out the forms, mid form drop off, increased calls.

670
01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:05.710
Lea Howland: complaints, poor word of mouth!

671
01:04:06.214 --> 01:04:16.590
Lea Howland: And then so the next step. So after they, after they make a purchase, or after quick consideration, we are

672
01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:21.469
Lea Howland: going to move this because this is I was confused myself. This goes into actual.

673
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:23.800
Dennis Kelleher: For your last point you've been trying to

674
01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:27.479
Dennis Kelleher: for existing to cross, promote the auto

675
01:04:27.490 --> 01:04:52.150
Dennis Kelleher: auto like in the experience, cross promote auto in the experience. Right? Are you sure you don't want this? Right? Do you know, do you know, here are the benefits of it? Yeah. Is that captured? It is in the form. Yeah, you can. You can choose it, but I don't know if it's it's not served up. As to why it's good. You have to go search for it in the pages above. Right? That'll change. But I think there is something just, you know, you know there should be. It's a peace of mind. Yeah, right? Right?

676
01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.260
Dennis Kelleher: And we should

677
01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:56.050
Dennis Kelleher: over promote that. Yeah, right?

678
01:04:56.310 --> 01:04:58.140
Dennis Kelleher: That's what we want ultimately.

679
01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:00.270
Dennis Kelleher: And I think we captured that.

680
01:05:01.050 --> 01:05:04.390
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah. Somewhere in there, on one of the steps.

681
01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:07.197
Lea Howland: What was that? Sorry I was cleaning up what I had written?

682
01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:15.230
Dennis Kelleher: He was just talking about how we should be pushing. It's almost like cross. It's cross selling

683
01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:38.269
Dennis Kelleher: auto pay to existing users because of. Here's why it's like, Well, you know you could. I mean, that's where you could say, Hey, you would get an additional 5 cents off each. Yeah. And I think we. I think when the discounts come out we are going to have that. So I don't think we do a good job of that now. They're developing those. Still, we're all saying the same thing. Yep.

684
01:05:38.810 --> 01:05:39.810
Dennis Kelleher: Next bucket.

685
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.020
Dennis Kelleher: Sorry.

686
01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:52.719
Lea Howland: These ideas are helpful. I just put them in whatever wherever they need to go, so as long as we write them down, it's helpful to have as we start planning out what that actual journey, what what it actually looks like on the site.

687
01:05:53.670 --> 01:06:07.739
Lea Howland: So for the analytics side. So the Kpis. We want to measure for this journey, I'm saying, portal logins versus calling in actual ports portal signups, if they're new purchases by now clicks and form completions.

688
01:06:08.848 --> 01:06:13.230
Lea Howland: I believe those would probably capture everything around purchases successfully.

689
01:06:17.350 --> 01:06:18.260
Lea Howland: Okay.

690
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:21.850
Lea Howland: so we are now halfway through.

691
01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:36.369
Lea Howland: so this one is an area that I did have a few more questions on around what we consider success for this journey. So this is learning more. About half, nurse. I'm going to zoom in a little bit. So you guys can read this. I know it's small.

692
01:06:36.830 --> 01:06:58.880
Lea Howland: So this is all of the content that a user is going to to understand who you are. Your business values, what you have to offer, why they should choose Halfner. So it's kind of considered that classic more like about me section on the page, maybe, or what you do for your community. I know you also mentioned the the was the ikf it Kickstar nation.

693
01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.109
Dennis Kelleher: Foundation yep.

694
01:07:00.110 --> 01:07:02.509
Lea Howland: Okay. So I'm gonna add that in here as well.

695
01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:09.550
Dennis Kelleher: So obviously, safety is important, too. Do we talk about the fam like the family value at all

696
01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:12.119
Dennis Kelleher: our core values? Yeah.

697
01:07:13.830 --> 01:07:18.109
Dennis Kelleher: no, that could be. Yeah. It should be definitely part of our core tenants. Yeah, yeah.

698
01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:23.150
Dennis Kelleher: And safe and safety. Yup.

699
01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:28.220
Dennis Kelleher: yeah, it's part of our safety needs its own segment of

700
01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:32.440
Dennis Kelleher: being an Sme in the space dovetail. Out of that go deeper in there.

701
01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:35.379
Dennis Kelleher: It's a big focus. Yeah.

702
01:07:36.636 --> 01:07:39.470
Dennis Kelleher: it's a huge huge priority.

703
01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:41.760
Dennis Kelleher: We sell things that go boom.

704
01:07:41.890 --> 01:07:43.930
Dennis Kelleher: Here's how we're doing it safely

705
01:07:45.330 --> 01:07:52.780
Dennis Kelleher: where he was backing up, and I was like all he needs to do is take a 1 run, and I am done for it.

706
01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:57.438
Dennis Kelleher: That's catchy. It is. Hope you're a good near neighborhood.

707
01:07:58.060 --> 01:07:59.389
Dennis Kelleher: We were also.

708
01:07:59.390 --> 01:08:06.909
Lea Howland: Talking internally. I know. I think it's Bucky's that has like a page on the site that says they want awards for how clean their bathrooms are.

709
01:08:06.910 --> 01:08:08.450
Dennis Kelleher: And so.

710
01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:34.760
Lea Howland: We were kind of thinking of. You know. What? What is the way that we could have fun with that information as well on your site and being able to showcase like, here's the things that like people always talk about like we always know to stop at a half nurse on our trip because we can trust that you guys are clean, or we can under trust that you guys have a safe location or that we're not going to be accosted anywhere. So I think that kind of comes down to also, like the family values, some level.

711
01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:36.179
Dennis Kelleher: That's like the aspect.

712
01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:38.890
Dennis Kelleher: Know what costing going on here.

713
01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:44.260
Dennis Kelleher: We promote no accosting going on here. Yeah.

714
01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:47.282
Lea Howland: Tagline. You're welcome. I'll be here all day.

715
01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:51.699
Dennis Kelleher: The end of the day, you know. It's getting a little punchy now.

716
01:08:52.760 --> 01:09:10.680
Lea Howland: Community involvement. So that could be, I was thinking, well, I we've also seen a couple of like the location pages where some companies offer specifically to that location what you do within that community space there, or we can do more globally or like I guess regionally.

717
01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:11.739
Dennis Kelleher: Interesting to me. But

718
01:09:12.010 --> 01:09:20.181
Dennis Kelleher: but looking at it from, you know, a site perspective, what we do?

719
01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:24.159
Dennis Kelleher: That's it. Positive meaning from a testimonial standpoint.

720
01:09:25.319 --> 01:09:27.520
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah, I'm just trying to figure something like that.

721
01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:28.390
Lea Howland: Bye.

722
01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:38.609
Dennis Kelleher: We don't have anything best, this or anything. We don't have any of those things yet to really be able to say Yay, you know. I mean, we're working towards those, but we just don't have anything really.

723
01:09:39.550 --> 01:09:47.242
Lea Howland: You can quote me, and I'll just say that you have the best clean bathrooms, and just say Leah says so. I think that works

724
01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:48.350
Dennis Kelleher: Claimed.

725
01:09:49.649 --> 01:09:50.219
Lea Howland: I was.

726
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:51.309
Dennis Kelleher: I'm also thinking.

727
01:09:51.310 --> 01:10:07.020
Lea Howland: I wasn't sure if there were certain locations that maybe participate in certain community events or things that you want to promote locally to certain areas, or like how to get involved with your local halfners. For you know.

728
01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:18.139
Dennis Kelleher: Well, that should be under the it kicks foundation for the side of things which fall in. We do other things, too, though we do other things. Yeah. But there's sponsorships that we do.

729
01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:27.790
Dennis Kelleher: Kind of, yeah, I guess. So, yeah, like, there's still community events, though, like done the pumpkin regatta up in Goffs Town few years in a row. And

730
01:10:28.370 --> 01:10:31.180
Dennis Kelleher: it's just small things like that of part of the community.

731
01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:35.330
Dennis Kelleher: The pumpkins got it. That's pretty fun, actually.

732
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:45.099
Dennis Kelleher: how do we? But are we trying to get it to the store specific? Because it's not so? Does that hit on store pages? Or is that about everything like just

733
01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:47.650
Dennis Kelleher: illustrating. Maybe that's fine.

734
01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:48.610
Dennis Kelleher: I

735
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:52.360
Dennis Kelleher: actually good question.

736
01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:53.340
Dennis Kelleher: I thought.

737
01:10:53.530 --> 01:10:59.090
Dennis Kelleher: would I would. I care to see what's happening where I live today? Do I care what's happening in Golf town or not?

738
01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:01.209
Dennis Kelleher: Maybe not. But if you're involved.

739
01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:12.007
Dennis Kelleher: but if that's what I'm saying, you go to your area and your questions should be there, or should it just be in the more broad.

740
01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:21.179
Lea Howland: And and maybe it's also not necessarily that they want to get involved. But it could shift their opinion about you guys. So if they search the location, and that they see that location.

741
01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:21.450
Dennis Kelleher: Yes.

742
01:11:21.450 --> 01:11:26.080
Lea Howland: Involved with, like, maybe, like the local Girl Scouts or a local football foundation, they're like.

743
01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:30.770
Dennis Kelleher: That's awesome because we would be the community store. Right? I mean, right? Just what we did it.

744
01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.600
Dennis Kelleher: Gloucester. Yeah.

745
01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:37.350
Dennis Kelleher: With the supporting

746
01:11:37.770 --> 01:11:38.430
Dennis Kelleher: right.

747
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:44.460
Dennis Kelleher: We did the schooner festival, the fireworks. We did a lot of stuff there

748
01:11:45.090 --> 01:11:47.310
Dennis Kelleher: this year, a local band.

749
01:11:47.790 --> 01:11:49.319
Dennis Kelleher: and we also did the

750
01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:52.719
Dennis Kelleher: Alzheimer's, which I couldn't think of a name.

751
01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.640
Dennis Kelleher: So you laugh.

752
01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:05.620
Lea Howland: For this section we would consider success a. Perhaps people have changed their opinion about your company.

753
01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:07.110
Lea Howland: Yes.

754
01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:16.980
Dennis Kelleher: Are we are we gonna have a are we gonna have a space on there for people to be able to say, Reach out to us.

755
01:12:17.150 --> 01:12:19.033
Dennis Kelleher: if you like a submit.

756
01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:20.540
Dennis Kelleher: submit

757
01:12:20.930 --> 01:12:21.850
Dennis Kelleher: for

758
01:12:22.210 --> 01:12:43.240
Dennis Kelleher: like partnerships and well partnerships. But community donations, I mean, we should. You know what I mean? Oh, yeah, you mean to some right reach out? Right? Yeah, we should have a definitely, absolutely, that's going to be community initiatives. Yeah, community initiatives. Selfishly, I don't. But yes, we should.

759
01:12:44.240 --> 01:13:01.279
Dennis Kelleher: They can go filter out, we. That's what we'd have to do. We'd have to get a form. It'll dump in. It'll just dump into a right? No. But seriously, it's like a website. It's a form on the website. I mean, it's so common. It is common. We always had that. So.

760
01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:07.040
Lea Howland: Does the It kicks foundation, have its own landing page or Mini website. Now.

761
01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:09.220
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah, it does. It does.

762
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:15.500
Lea Howland: Okay, so would we want to link out to that for a form to complete any type of donation.

763
01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:18.849
Dennis Kelleher: That's different. No, that's different. Yeah. But it's gonna come in.

764
01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:29.729
Dennis Kelleher: I mean, we have to rebuild a kicks foundations part of the site, anyway, but how they do their donations. They meet as they meet as a board and decide who they're going to give money to. It's not

765
01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:34.059
Dennis Kelleher: it kicks commute. Maybe there's an it kicks.

766
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:37.490
Dennis Kelleher: There's a separate one for that. Yeah.

767
01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:43.300
Dennis Kelleher: I mean, it's important. I think we have to highlight the. It takes community foundation that goes.

768
01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:49.999
Dennis Kelleher: we we have to suss it out. We need to do some discovery with our 8 kicks team.

769
01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:54.829
Lea Howland: Okay? Yeah. Cause I would assume there's some level of technology that would have to go into place.

770
01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:55.680
Dennis Kelleher: This.

771
01:13:56.730 --> 01:13:57.330
Dennis Kelleher: it's.

772
01:13:57.330 --> 01:13:58.200
Lea Howland: So

773
01:13:58.781 --> 01:14:12.328
Lea Howland: I would also say, for people who are exploring about you guys. So perhaps they've done some research before applying for a job or they're more informed about

774
01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:18.441
Lea Howland: I guess the safety aspect.

775
01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:25.080
Lea Howland: oh, I feel like this is kind of be can kind of be generalized as to. They've changed their opinions on half.

776
01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:29.048
Dennis Kelleher: What's the success look like? No, this is the

777
01:14:29.490 --> 01:14:30.940
Lea Howland: What does success look like.

778
01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:32.222
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah, yeah, sorry.

779
01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:38.869
Lea Howland: You're fine. I wish I could like freeze the the left column, but I can't. So I can't

780
01:14:39.150 --> 01:14:40.199
Lea Howland: have it on screen.

781
01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:43.510
Dennis Kelleher: It's not an excel sheet where you can really collapse it and move it right.

782
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:44.170
Lea Howland: Yeah.

783
01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:47.990
Dennis Kelleher: It's where Excel still is still

784
01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:51.250
Dennis Kelleher: still winning, still winning.

785
01:14:52.030 --> 01:14:56.232
Lea Howland: Holding down the fort. I would say. They've

786
01:14:58.070 --> 01:15:01.530
Lea Howland: Perhaps they get involved with the foundation.

787
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:12.720
Dennis Kelleher: Reach out, or more community like reaching out to us, you know, because you said before, if they wanted to do a community type thing. It's more of that community. Yeah.

788
01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:15.360
Dennis Kelleher: this is the about

789
01:15:15.650 --> 01:15:17.379
Dennis Kelleher: what success looks like.

790
01:15:19.123 --> 01:15:19.849
Lea Howland: they.

791
01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:22.439
Dennis Kelleher: You know what I think success is, if it

792
01:15:23.190 --> 01:15:25.219
Dennis Kelleher: if they link over

793
01:15:25.330 --> 01:15:26.679
Dennis Kelleher: to an action like

794
01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:31.540
Dennis Kelleher: no, if they link over to cause I before I would ever apply anywhere

795
01:15:31.830 --> 01:15:41.849
Dennis Kelleher: I wouldn't want. I want to learn about how I got here. I have no idea now, but I would want to learn about who I'm working for. That seems interested.

796
01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:44.340
Dennis Kelleher: Can it link over to the

797
01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:47.940
Dennis Kelleher: career section careers section.

798
01:15:48.970 --> 01:15:59.309
Lea Howland: Yeah, I believe there is gonna be a level of content regarding obviously like benefits and about halfners in the job seeker section as well, so it's finding a good kind of.

799
01:15:59.682 --> 01:16:03.030
Dennis Kelleher: Between. Is this a good way to get right.

800
01:16:04.170 --> 01:16:04.890
Lea Howland: for me.

801
01:16:04.890 --> 01:16:05.150
Dennis Kelleher: This is.

802
01:16:05.150 --> 01:16:05.800
Lea Howland: More of like.

803
01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:06.400
Dennis Kelleher: Yes.

804
01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:07.979
Dennis Kelleher: we do. A deep dive.

805
01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:11.779
Lea Howland: Free. Oh, the our story stuff! We don't have that listed here.

806
01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:12.990
Dennis Kelleher: Oh, the history!

807
01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:14.070
Dennis Kelleher: Yes.

808
01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:14.709
Lea Howland: That's pretty big.

809
01:16:14.710 --> 01:16:16.540
Dennis Kelleher: Thank you. That's a big one.

810
01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:25.170
Lea Howland: Let's pause there and consider failure.

811
01:16:25.170 --> 01:16:28.410
Dennis Kelleher: What about energy North? We need to include them in the about

812
01:16:30.490 --> 01:16:40.519
Dennis Kelleher: in 2015, happily, was purchased by energy. North Group. Okay, if they want to learn more. There, they're gonna pop to the new. But do we need to capture it, I guess, is my question.

813
01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:46.620
Lea Howland: I mean, there's like the classic classic about Halfner's page.

814
01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:49.220
Dennis Kelleher: It's fine.

815
01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:52.329
Dennis Kelleher: We'll be in the history part of it, too.

816
01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:56.610
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah. So we lay out the energy north in the history book.

817
01:16:58.130 --> 01:17:00.589
Dennis Kelleher: It's not in 2,015. You gotta mention it on there.

818
01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:03.469
Dennis Kelleher: Okay.

819
01:17:04.670 --> 01:17:06.367
Lea Howland: Oh, sorry! Did I miss something I didn't.

820
01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:12.879
Dennis Kelleher: No, no, just once I take the down. Once we take donkey out of the underneath logo, I'll do it. Yeah.

821
01:17:13.930 --> 01:17:23.020
Dennis Kelleher: I think it's a great idea. We're just gonna improve and modernize their logo.

822
01:17:24.250 --> 01:17:25.930
Lea Howland: For failure for this journey.

823
01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:28.900
Lea Howland: I would say, people

824
01:17:30.210 --> 01:17:32.890
Lea Howland: I feel like it's pretty straightforward. People

825
01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:38.600
Lea Howland: like don't understand. You guys I'm trying to think of like.

826
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:43.439
Lea Howland: for this, people would probably start.

827
01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:48.539
Lea Howland: I don't know, talking poorly about your community.

828
01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:49.510
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah, that's a.

829
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.790
Lea Howland: Like.

830
01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:53.689
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah, bad reviews. Anything of that nature would be. I mean, it's almost a

831
01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:55.619
Dennis Kelleher: lift from the left.

832
01:17:55.950 --> 01:17:56.910
Lea Howland: Yeah, yeah.

833
01:17:57.810 --> 01:18:00.850
Dennis Kelleher: I don't think customer service calls would happen.

834
01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:09.897
Dennis Kelleher: I already are confused. We're trying to unconfuse confusing site.

835
01:18:10.890 --> 01:18:11.619
Lea Howland: I know you guys are.

836
01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:11.940
Dennis Kelleher: Bye.

837
01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:13.020
Lea Howland: Have not done our job yet.

838
01:18:20.350 --> 01:18:23.299
BreAnn Kopcza: I would, I would imagine you'd also like

839
01:18:23.490 --> 01:18:27.179
BreAnn Kopcza: there, this seems like there's gonna be a lot of content, so

840
01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:37.149
BreAnn Kopcza: that we, you know, want to share ideally. But so we're gonna have to figure out a way to like, get people through a flow of information. So as maybe a failure would be like

841
01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:40.669
BreAnn Kopcza: their their flow. It it ends at like one page.

842
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:45.150
BreAnn Kopcza: right? Like they don't go into more detail, or

843
01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.769
BreAnn Kopcza: they aren't necessarily like

844
01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:48.490
BreAnn Kopcza: exactly.

845
01:18:48.490 --> 01:18:54.800
Dennis Kelleher: Like it's a are we looking at hover rates or something, and saying they were there for a nanosecond, and they left, or I mean, I don't know.

846
01:18:54.800 --> 01:19:05.930
Lea Howland: The way we could say, like Page, flows, and like Ga. 4, for instance, like if they are, even if you use a tool, like hot jar or mouse, flow, or Microsoft clarity, where you can see like friction.

847
01:19:05.930 --> 01:19:06.720
Dennis Kelleher: Good point, sir.

848
01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:07.520
Lea Howland: Confusion.

849
01:19:08.047 --> 01:19:09.299
Lea Howland: I love Microsoft.

850
01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:12.570
Dennis Kelleher: We should, we will. I like those. Yeah, we will

851
01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:14.370
Dennis Kelleher: definitely.

852
01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:15.800
Dennis Kelleher: That's fascinating.

853
01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:19.059
Lea Howland: So this is an area that I wasn't entirely.

854
01:19:19.060 --> 01:19:21.880
Dennis Kelleher: Sure it's actionable, too. Yeah.

855
01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:23.460
Dennis Kelleher: Go ahead. Sorry.

856
01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:33.320
Lea Howland: Oh, no, you're totally fine. I I geek out over Microsoft clarity. I love watching the videos and stuff on there and seeing how people are interacting with the site. So I'm all for it.

857
01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:40.459
Lea Howland: so this was an area that I wasn't entirely sure what we wanted them to do after visiting the.

858
01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:41.830
Dennis Kelleher: Well, yes.

859
01:19:42.264 --> 01:19:44.869
Lea Howland: So is it. We want them.

860
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:46.079
Dennis Kelleher: That's a good one.

861
01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:54.019
Lea Howland: Is it social? What do we want them to sign up for email? Do we want them to find like new ways to get involved, or

862
01:19:54.190 --> 01:19:57.849
Lea Howland: you know, I know there's a path for job seekers.

863
01:19:57.850 --> 01:19:58.859
Dennis Kelleher: These buckets?

864
01:19:59.830 --> 01:20:00.640
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah.

865
01:20:01.230 --> 01:20:09.110
Dennis Kelleher: visiting social and and and that, I think, goes across a lot of the buckets right? So it goes across the

866
01:20:09.570 --> 01:20:13.119
Dennis Kelleher: the other ones to the left, to the left.

867
01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:19.033
Dennis Kelleher: We gotta grow that 2,400 Facebook user distribution.

868
01:20:20.855 --> 01:20:32.269
Lea Howland: I would assume they'd want to learn. Keep learning more about the business, even if they haven't bought oil. So signing up for email, what's the type? What's content that you guys can share? That's more of thought, leadership or industry knowledge

869
01:20:32.643 --> 01:20:33.939
Lea Howland: to help them understand.

870
01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:35.969
Dennis Kelleher: Do we want anything about Telus?

871
01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:41.049
Dennis Kelleher: We want to interest them in telling us about

872
01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:46.449
Dennis Kelleher: customer feedback like any feedback that would be good. Yeah.

873
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:54.815
Dennis Kelleher: Tell us what we better. What would you want in our stores? What do you know? How can we improve? How can we improve

874
01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:56.953
Dennis Kelleher: suggestion box.

875
01:20:57.630 --> 01:21:01.809
Dennis Kelleher: Right? I mean, yeah, more or less, it's a digital one. Yeah. But it says that I am.

876
01:21:05.610 --> 01:21:08.769
Lea Howland: I would say, visit Job seeker

877
01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:10.010
Lea Howland: portal

878
01:21:10.050 --> 01:21:11.970
Lea Howland: is applicable.

879
01:21:14.230 --> 01:21:20.399
Lea Howland: And then the ways that we would actually track that. So I would say, social link clicks.

880
01:21:20.930 --> 01:21:22.189
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah.

881
01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:24.070
Dennis Kelleher: in increased

882
01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:25.770
Dennis Kelleher: engagement. Yeah.

883
01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:27.939
Lea Howland: Increased. I would say.

884
01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:28.910
Dennis Kelleher: Engagement

885
01:21:29.310 --> 01:21:30.810
Dennis Kelleher: users. Chat.

886
01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:32.770
Dennis Kelleher: yeah.

887
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:41.300
Dennis Kelleher: email sign ups. Right?

888
01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:45.304
Dennis Kelleher: Well, once we have an email strategy of what they're doing.

889
01:21:45.690 --> 01:21:46.859
Dennis Kelleher: we're gonna have one

890
01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:50.630
Dennis Kelleher: roadmap.

891
01:21:51.744 --> 01:21:54.919
Lea Howland: Alright. So last 2

892
01:21:55.060 --> 01:22:07.650
Lea Howland: we've got find a new job and then evaluate commercial hops offering. So find a new job. We've got about probably 12 min for each one, so I will try to stick to that time.

893
01:22:08.010 --> 01:22:23.429
Lea Howland: so these are people that are either searching for corporate retail or hops job listings. I know one of the needs for the content is a dynamic job. Search filtering. That was something that we talked about during the audience journey was a better, better way to showcase

894
01:22:23.825 --> 01:22:36.239
Lea Howland: or just search for jobs, and within those different categories. So and we had, we covered a pretty good amount of the content necessary. But just for a quick review corporate we talked about. I could spell

895
01:22:38.430 --> 01:22:39.610
Lea Howland: office imagery.

896
01:22:39.610 --> 01:22:41.050
Dennis Kelleher: Showcase, it hubs

897
01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:42.950
Dennis Kelleher: alright.

898
01:22:43.210 --> 01:22:44.139
Lea Howland: I'm sorry. What was that?

899
01:22:44.650 --> 01:22:46.330
Dennis Kelleher: Spelling errors

900
01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:47.920
Dennis Kelleher: showcase it.

901
01:22:48.986 --> 01:22:57.100
Lea Howland: This is what happens when I type too fast. Corporate office imagery locations, content around upward movement, testimonials and benefits perks

902
01:22:57.140 --> 01:23:00.337
Lea Howland: for retail options for in-store deployment,

903
01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:19.629
Lea Howland: locations, growth, opportunities and benefits. And then for the hop showcase, different divisions. So tax drivers dispatch, etc, environmental safety truck lineup values and benefits anything else you think, content, wise, that we would need for a better experience here.

904
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:31.429
Dennis Kelleher: The only thing I might add, and I will need to talk to Greg Sarah about this, and from a legal perspective are we able to interested in driving the big rigs click here

905
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:33.720
Dennis Kelleher: and goes to abs

906
01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:36.432
Dennis Kelleher: just as a feeder.

907
01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:41.740
Dennis Kelleher: Right? Yeah, that makes sense.

908
01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:43.949
Dennis Kelleher: especially for them. Right? Yup.

909
01:23:44.650 --> 01:23:46.999
Dennis Kelleher: the big. They're the 18 wheelers.

910
01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:05.360
Dennis Kelleher: Like corporate doesn't have values. Of course we should have those, but

911
01:24:05.850 --> 01:24:08.110
Dennis Kelleher: kind of goes without saying, well.

912
01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:08.720
Lea Howland: Oh, yeah.

913
01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:12.610
Dennis Kelleher: I mean values is across it all. That's my point. I mean, across all

914
01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:18.196
Dennis Kelleher: the values are of everything that's in the front of it like I'm just making sure it's covered.

915
01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:30.660
Lea Howland: Yeah, there will be some level of content on like benefits and perks and values of why work at Hafner's? Within this location as well. And then I would imagine that we would divvy it up all right. Now search for your type of role.

916
01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:31.160
Dennis Kelleher: Exactly.

917
01:24:31.590 --> 01:24:32.880
Lea Howland: And then right.

918
01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:38.830
Dennis Kelleher: I was only calling it out because it wasn't hops, but it wasn't in corporate. Well, it should just be up top right of everything.

919
01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:42.439
Dennis Kelleher: values, vision, mission position, blah, blah.

920
01:24:45.690 --> 01:24:46.300
Lea Howland: Jeff.

921
01:24:47.150 --> 01:24:50.892
Lea Howland: And some of this was also stream of consciousness. So good good eye,

922
01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:53.560
Dennis Kelleher: Okay.

923
01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:58.999
Lea Howland: So for success around this section, I would say, a user

924
01:24:59.370 --> 01:25:03.719
Lea Howland: is able to easily differentiate which type of role they want.

925
01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:05.640
Dennis Kelleher: Correct.

926
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:07.080
Dennis Kelleher: if.

927
01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:11.060
Lea Howland: For I'm spelling that wrong differentiate which.

928
01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:12.720
Dennis Kelleher: Need, another need, another f.

929
01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:15.840
Lea Howland: They won't do. I? Oh, my goodness.

930
01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:17.259
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah, you need another f 1. There, yeah.

931
01:25:19.190 --> 01:25:20.380
Lea Howland: That's not true, right?

932
01:25:20.570 --> 01:25:22.939
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah, differentiate stuff differ.

933
01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:27.239
Dennis Kelleher: I thought you said that those 2 are already there.

934
01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:28.219
Dennis Kelleher: Okay.

935
01:25:32.555 --> 01:25:33.200
Lea Howland: I.

936
01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:34.140
Dennis Kelleher: Let's say.

937
01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:38.680
Lea Howland: Increased job applications.

938
01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:43.490
Lea Howland: yep.

939
01:25:45.493 --> 01:25:46.819
Dennis Kelleher: Excitement mode.

940
01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:50.629
Dennis Kelleher: half nurse working the potential of working at half. Nurse.

941
01:25:58.370 --> 01:26:00.299
Dennis Kelleher: How are we gonna know that? How do we measure that?

942
01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:07.710
Dennis Kelleher: Let me ask him, are you excited about applying for this year? Yeah, I guess I am.

943
01:26:07.710 --> 01:26:08.440
Lea Howland: We shouted.

944
01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:10.109
Dennis Kelleher: Increase job applications.

945
01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:13.659
Lea Howland: Yeah, it's that would be that would definitely

946
01:26:13.870 --> 01:26:16.700
Lea Howland: be probably almost impossible to measure unless there's

947
01:26:17.210 --> 01:26:17.760
Lea Howland: it's an app.

948
01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:23.212
Lea Howland: During the interview process or application process of like, How excited are you?

949
01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:27.429
Dennis Kelleher: Is this? Is this success outcome? Or is this measurement.

950
01:26:28.690 --> 01:26:29.360
Lea Howland: This is.

951
01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:30.980
Dennis Kelleher: Just overall 6.

952
01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:32.000
Lea Howland: Yes, so.

953
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.249
Dennis Kelleher: What does it look like here.

954
01:26:33.250 --> 01:26:40.169
Lea Howland: Yeah, what? What do we really want them to happen? Because then failure for this one, I think, is pretty straightforward. They don't fill out jobs.

955
01:26:40.170 --> 01:26:41.900
Dennis Kelleher: No replicants.

956
01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:44.400
Lea Howland: I would say decrease.

957
01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:46.980
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah.

958
01:26:47.290 --> 01:26:48.450
Lea Howland: Decreased

959
01:26:48.490 --> 01:26:50.539
Lea Howland: job applications

960
01:26:51.610 --> 01:26:54.400
Lea Howland: say, page drop offs.

961
01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:58.189
Dennis Kelleher: Decrease visits to page. Yeah. Glass door.

962
01:26:58.430 --> 01:27:00.639
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah, I was. Gonna say, those 2 reviews.

963
01:27:01.410 --> 01:27:08.090
Dennis Kelleher: no glass door reviews, is it? Glassdoor reviews? Yeah. Glassdoor reviews.

964
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:09.000
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah.

965
01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:13.640
Dennis Kelleher: that usually happens after people leave.

966
01:27:14.850 --> 01:27:21.619
Dennis Kelleher: Post. But even if they had a bad experience, yeah, even a bad interview experience never know. Experience. Yeah, yeah, I've seen those.

967
01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:23.030
Dennis Kelleher: Yup!

968
01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:28.729
Lea Howland: And so obviously the next step here is they apply for a job.

969
01:27:30.430 --> 01:27:31.170
Dennis Kelleher: Sounds good.

970
01:27:32.020 --> 01:27:45.445
Lea Howland: And then I would say, to measure that I would say I threw in there like search usage. So people are searching for jobs near me, or jobs at Hafner's job. Application completions,

971
01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:51.294
Lea Howland: I think, are are pretty straightforward for for measurements here.

972
01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:57.200
Dennis Kelleher: Quality of I don't know how you determine that, though. Quality of applicant. I don't know if you how you determine that. Really.

973
01:27:57.770 --> 01:27:58.800
Dennis Kelleher: that'd be tough.

974
01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:00.420
Dennis Kelleher: It's

975
01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:03.660
Dennis Kelleher: just like, Yeah, I know how to do. So you have to turn around.

976
01:28:03.660 --> 01:28:04.740
Lea Howland: How do you measure that.

977
01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:11.620
Dennis Kelleher: I mean, because at this point it we're passing it over to velocity, which we need to work on that

978
01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:15.129
Dennis Kelleher: as well, because that's a terrible process.

979
01:28:16.170 --> 01:28:17.870
Dennis Kelleher: It's not segmented. Very well.

980
01:28:18.190 --> 01:28:23.839
Lea Howland: Possible referrals. Maybe there's a way to track. If somebody has referred somebody to work at Hapner's.

981
01:28:24.290 --> 01:28:27.401
Dennis Kelleher: Oh, yeah, we do have a referral program

982
01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:29.710
Dennis Kelleher: which

983
01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:41.560
Dennis Kelleher: Edwin talked a lot about it. Actually, you know, yeah, like talking to the drivers about it a lot because they always need drivers. He's like I got 2,500 bucks for referral program.

984
01:28:45.230 --> 01:28:46.859
Lea Howland: do we talk about that referral.

985
01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:47.440
Dennis Kelleher: To.

986
01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:51.760
Dennis Kelleher: No, we need to talk about that up top. It's a good thing to flag.

987
01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:02.189
Dennis Kelleher: It's a referral pro program across the board. Actually, I think, for hops.

988
01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:24.970
Dennis Kelleher: Well, there's a referral. Yeah, it's referral program for that. But it's a different referral program. There's a referral program for customers. Right? So there's a customer referral program. Then there's a job referral program. I'm just wondering if we captured the other referral program. Yeah, did we? Okay.

989
01:29:26.530 --> 01:29:30.589
Dennis Kelleher: gone through so many. Now I don't. Yeah.

990
01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:41.033
Lea Howland: And I think so. These 3 sum up the analytics of what we'd want to measure for that I would also say,

991
01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:43.010
Lea Howland: huge visits.

992
01:29:45.230 --> 01:29:45.510
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah.

993
01:29:46.090 --> 01:29:48.939
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah, definitely anything with Linkedin on this.

994
01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:52.650
Dennis Kelleher: And I know it's just another social site.

995
01:29:52.710 --> 01:29:55.559
Dennis Kelleher: Congratulations. I just got a new job. Yeah.

996
01:29:55.710 --> 01:29:57.920
Dennis Kelleher: no, I don't think so.

997
01:30:00.250 --> 01:30:03.280
Dennis Kelleher: but we do need to up our Linkedin profile.

998
01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:06.429
Dennis Kelleher: I do agree with that.

999
01:30:07.090 --> 01:30:11.150
Dennis Kelleher: I struggled with that one when I was looking about. Yeah.

1000
01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:27.710
Lea Howland: So for our last journey. Last, but definitely, not least, one of the bigger ones, and possibly the one that we need to consider the most, because I feel like this, one has the least amount of information on the site currently is the commercial hops, offerings.

1001
01:30:28.167 --> 01:30:40.239
Lea Howland: And so this is a user business is looking to understand or the delivery around the delivery services. For various fuel types or maintenance service based on their industry needs.

1002
01:30:40.370 --> 01:30:48.699
Lea Howland: So for content that we need for the site right now. Brianne's done a great job of planning this out for the journey mapping as well. So when we get there.

1003
01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:53.320
Dennis Kelleher: Basically, all this is all that you did earlier.

1004
01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:54.250
Lea Howland: Oh, really

1005
01:30:55.230 --> 01:30:59.179
Dennis Kelleher: We had a meeting earlier kind of going over the same.

1006
01:30:59.180 --> 01:31:07.560
Lea Howland: Oh, okay, well, we can hopefully rush through it. Then if you guys already have all this stuff, so of course.

1007
01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:10.613
Dennis Kelleher: I gotta make this a Sebastian show.

1008
01:31:11.980 --> 01:31:23.080
Lea Howland: For this I have listed just this is kind of bubbling everything together but fuel, delivery, onsite availability, content by industry. So the commercial, industrial agricultural needs.

1009
01:31:23.477 --> 01:31:28.869
Lea Howland: equipment, servicing options. So this is more of like the Hvac. Or any type of equipment.

1010
01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:30.450
Dennis Kelleher: That's large.

1011
01:31:30.450 --> 01:31:39.750
Lea Howland: Large scale process content. So this is the how to work with Hafner's the pricing options, testimonials.

1012
01:31:40.732 --> 01:31:48.580
Lea Howland: by industry, and then outdoor living. So this is the restaurants, the local pools. Anything that was more slightly

1013
01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:52.739
Lea Howland: less industrial, but still large scale.

1014
01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:59.150
Lea Howland: Anything else that I haven't called out here that you guys maybe even spoke about.

1015
01:31:59.549 --> 01:32:04.749
Dennis Kelleher: Services is kind of like the equipment servicing options. I think that's where.

1016
01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:07.416
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah, okay, miss. There,

1017
01:32:08.540 --> 01:32:14.880
Dennis Kelleher: process. Okay, that's good. That was one of the things I'm just trying to think about your web page. I'm trying to think of your web page, and I'm trying to go through

1018
01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:23.580
Dennis Kelleher: the tanks rent versus is that I mean all that's covered. Yeah, that's pretty good.

1019
01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:26.009
Lea Howland: Those are high level buckets, awesome.

1020
01:32:26.306 --> 01:32:30.460
Dennis Kelleher: So can I ask some? We need to figure out where fleets gonna go

1021
01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:32.740
Dennis Kelleher: psychoanipate.

1022
01:32:35.130 --> 01:32:38.100
Dennis Kelleher: Oh, in here I'm here. I'll go where?

1023
01:32:39.050 --> 01:32:42.739
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah, that's another bucket. Kinda yeah, I don't know if that's yeah.

1024
01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:47.050
Dennis Kelleher: That's a 1 we didn't really discuss yet. I don't think

1025
01:32:48.890 --> 01:32:51.389
Dennis Kelleher: but it is in the roadmap of having fleet.

1026
01:32:51.710 --> 01:32:53.169
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah, okay, if you

1027
01:32:53.490 --> 01:32:55.289
Dennis Kelleher: make our way through this one, is he just.

1028
01:32:55.290 --> 01:33:02.550
Lea Howland: Are you? Are you saying Fleet would need its own journey, or fleet can be listed under the commercial services.

1029
01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:06.440
Lea Howland: and we just have page content for our fleet.

1030
01:33:08.970 --> 01:33:14.629
Dennis Kelleher: It, may it it may, it may leave live in. I can't live in our energy north. No

1031
01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:15.934
Dennis Kelleher: cool

1032
01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:20.870
Dennis Kelleher: It may need another journey I was, gonna I was gonna say, potentially a new one.

1033
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:28.959
Dennis Kelleher: You're talking about fleet. Yeah, it's it's it's really underdeveloped. It's a future state. Yeah, it's a separate entity really

1034
01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:35.639
Dennis Kelleher: from anything else on it is because it's a different pricing structure, right? I think it should be its own user and it

1035
01:33:35.730 --> 01:33:37.650
Dennis Kelleher: it involves fuel.

1036
01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:40.530
Dennis Kelleher: and for me car wash as well.

1037
01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:43.025
Dennis Kelleher: Yes.

1038
01:33:44.510 --> 01:33:45.070
Dennis Kelleher: yep.

1039
01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:49.100
Dennis Kelleher: sorry.

1040
01:33:49.460 --> 01:33:50.360
Dennis Kelleher: Sorry.

1041
01:33:52.320 --> 01:34:05.260
Lea Howland: So is there? Is there no world where maybe we provide fleet information under the car wash section that was already envisioned where it's like maybe residential car wash needs versus fleet car wash.

1042
01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:05.540
Dennis Kelleher: So.

1043
01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:07.110
Lea Howland: Needs. It would.

1044
01:34:07.110 --> 01:34:08.740
Dennis Kelleher: I don't

1045
01:34:08.810 --> 01:34:15.390
Dennis Kelleher: let us think about it. Okay, I I hear what you're saying, because it kind of fits under the retail car. Wash

1046
01:34:16.786 --> 01:34:18.020
Dennis Kelleher: fuel section.

1047
01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:26.269
Lea Howland: cause, it's almost like, choose, select your own needs, like, be having them.

1048
01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:27.710
Lea Howland: self, select.

1049
01:34:27.710 --> 01:34:40.329
Dennis Kelleher: More of a commercial need. Right? So this is a commercial play, and fleet reaches out to us, talking to Amazon. Distribution centers nearby to say, Hey, we can fill all your trucks, and here's why.

1050
01:34:40.330 --> 01:34:40.990
Lea Howland: Okay.

1051
01:34:40.990 --> 01:34:41.540
Dennis Kelleher: Okay.

1052
01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:49.629
Dennis Kelleher: sorry. Just I think I thought you said, Yeah, I thought you when we talked about originally, it was kind of like a.

1053
01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:59.139
Lea Howland: Oh, we did talk about in the audience journey. I thought it fell under the commercial offering journey.

1054
01:35:00.830 --> 01:35:01.740
Lea Howland: Adrian.

1055
01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:04.420
Dennis Kelleher: Could, but it would need its own journey within it.

1056
01:35:04.420 --> 01:35:12.480
BreAnn Kopcza: Yeah, I think what I'm what I'm picking up is yeah, that we. It is a commercial audience. However, the

1057
01:35:13.060 --> 01:35:21.249
BreAnn Kopcza: like, the mindset that people have coming in and what they, what we want to provide them. The information that they're gonna need is probably might be different.

1058
01:35:21.730 --> 01:35:23.859
BreAnn Kopcza: Just a different use case to kind of go through.

1059
01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:36.360
Dennis Kelleher: It is gonna be different. Yeah. Cause this one's more of like we deliver fuel to you commercially. The other fleet is you come to our station. You set up an account with us, and you get your fuel from us at the station.

1060
01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:36.870
Lea Howland: Okay.

1061
01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:43.919
Dennis Kelleher: Trying to reach for us, probably like procurement teams. Right? If you think about it.

1062
01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:45.840
Dennis Kelleher: it's a different journey, though I think.

1063
01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:47.689
BreAnn Kopcza: So, yeah, so so we can set it up

1064
01:35:48.230 --> 01:35:48.550
BreAnn Kopcza: it.

1065
01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:51.310
BreAnn Kopcza: yeah.

1066
01:35:51.310 --> 01:35:55.610
Dennis Kelleher: It's very we. We haven't really kicked it off. We're really trying to kick it off.

1067
01:35:56.060 --> 01:35:58.079
Dennis Kelleher: you know, early next year.

1068
01:35:59.054 --> 01:36:02.950
Dennis Kelleher: but it should be by the time we get this up. Yeah.

1069
01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:16.069
Lea Howland: That's totally fine. And that was part of the engagement today is like making sure that, like you guys agreed with all of the journeys that we that we planned out, and if there was anything we needed to add, so it's totally fine to add here, this is the time to add

1070
01:36:16.607 --> 01:36:19.390
Lea Howland: definitely, not after design. So this is

1071
01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:21.732
Lea Howland: totally fine. We'll get that figured out.

1072
01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:23.490
Dennis Kelleher: Fleet. Fleet.

1073
01:36:23.650 --> 01:36:24.560
Dennis Kelleher: Okay.

1074
01:36:25.304 --> 01:36:31.390
Lea Howland: Alright. So, aside from Fleet, considering all the other, the commercial, industrial, agricultural needs.

1075
01:36:31.410 --> 01:36:39.619
Lea Howland: what do we consider success for this journey? I would say, they we're under.

1076
01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:46.329
Lea Howland: I could spell clear understanding of Apner's offerings. Say.

1077
01:36:46.530 --> 01:36:46.730
Dennis Kelleher: Great.

1078
01:36:46.730 --> 01:37:01.219
Lea Howland: At least. We want to drive them to call in right, is there? Or is there any type of need for having a commercial form, or some type of process on the site? Or is it only going to be contacting a customer service agent.

1079
01:37:04.090 --> 01:37:05.770
Dennis Kelleher: I personally think if I'm

1080
01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:08.280
Dennis Kelleher: I mean you tell me

1081
01:37:08.310 --> 01:37:14.739
Dennis Kelleher: as a business, I would want to start with just an online form, even right.

1082
01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:17.619
Dennis Kelleher: And then that then

1083
01:37:18.535 --> 01:37:20.109
Dennis Kelleher: once we understand

1084
01:37:20.770 --> 01:37:22.750
Dennis Kelleher: the business, it goes in. And

1085
01:37:23.190 --> 01:37:27.380
Dennis Kelleher: I mean, we're not gonna send to our individual guys. That's absurd. Right?

1086
01:37:28.150 --> 01:37:40.610
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah, we can. They have a Crm now, so we can dump into there. You can go there. Yup, and that would be a lead for them. Yeah, yeah, I mean, I don't. I just assumed it would be obvious that we'd want to do that. Yeah, yeah.

1087
01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:41.810
Dennis Kelleher: if they.

1088
01:37:41.810 --> 01:37:42.189
Lea Howland: Now, if you.

1089
01:37:42.190 --> 01:37:45.724
Dennis Kelleher: All they need either. Or do you assume a lot of things are obvious here?

1090
01:37:48.570 --> 01:37:49.870
Dennis Kelleher: No, that's right.

1091
01:37:49.930 --> 01:37:53.669
Dennis Kelleher: We just want to cover all the touch points essentially increase, the calls

1092
01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:58.519
Dennis Kelleher: falls to customer service.

1093
01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:06.499
Lea Howland: Do you guys have separate customer service for your commercial lines of business and your residential? Or is it the same group that covers everything.

1094
01:38:06.910 --> 01:38:12.590
Dennis Kelleher: It. It's the same group, and what they'll do is they'd be able to route it. Then to

1095
01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:18.239
Dennis Kelleher: the sales, the sales question that's in that would be very timely question, I know, right

1096
01:38:19.290 --> 01:38:23.199
Dennis Kelleher: correct to the sale instead of it going to

1097
01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:26.729
Dennis Kelleher: Mike or Jeff, whatever it's gonna go through them, and they'll route it.

1098
01:38:27.530 --> 01:38:30.070
Dennis Kelleher: And Jeff, they would contact them back.

1099
01:38:30.350 --> 01:38:34.230
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah, the salesperson sales reps responsible for contacting them. Yeah.

1100
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:50.709
Lea Howland: I'm gonna say, overall more regional usage of your service offering. So having more people buy into long term, I would assume contracts with you guys I know

1101
01:38:50.800 --> 01:39:08.509
Lea Howland: getting having brand awareness be a crucial thing here of, you know, letting them know that you are a key player. In the industries, even if they aren't the 1st name that they've heard of. So really understanding you know, not just what you guys offer, but also making sure people are utilizing you guys more.

1102
01:39:08.830 --> 01:39:13.769
Dennis Kelleher: It is, I mean, ultimately, we wouldn't want to take that and push it into a sale and

1103
01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:15.870
Dennis Kelleher: have the attribution against

1104
01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:21.700
Dennis Kelleher: how many gallons did we push through the pipeline

1105
01:39:21.710 --> 01:39:24.480
Dennis Kelleher: sales increase, and we look at sales as gallons.

1106
01:39:27.310 --> 01:39:29.080
Dennis Kelleher: at least on that side.

1107
01:39:34.130 --> 01:39:35.990
Dennis Kelleher: There's not one of the other sides.

1108
01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:41.070
Lea Howland: Failure here, I would say they

1109
01:39:41.090 --> 01:39:43.120
Lea Howland: obviously purchased with a competitor.

1110
01:39:44.139 --> 01:39:45.070
Lea Howland: They.

1111
01:39:46.490 --> 01:39:48.299
Dennis Kelleher: Can? Can I jump back up.

1112
01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:49.079
Lea Howland: Oh, yeah. Go ahead.

1113
01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:51.619
Dennis Kelleher: My my hunch is is that

1114
01:39:52.870 --> 01:40:06.189
Dennis Kelleher: it's gonna be a few times again. It's a big commitment, and this is only the 1st route meaning to close if you will. Yeah, the closing is so long. All all we can do is get

1115
01:40:06.290 --> 01:40:09.929
Dennis Kelleher: customers in the hands, connect the dot, connect them. Yeah, right?

1116
01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:11.390
Dennis Kelleher: That's true.

1117
01:40:12.570 --> 01:40:13.230
Dennis Kelleher: Shit.

1118
01:40:13.370 --> 01:40:13.940
Dennis Kelleher: So.

1119
01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:14.210
Lea Howland: So.

1120
01:40:14.470 --> 01:40:23.140
Dennis Kelleher: The sales team has to close the deal. So meaning increase leads is probably the yeah. So not necessarily sales.

1121
01:40:23.180 --> 01:40:25.659
Dennis Kelleher: I think that makes sense. Yeah, increase leads

1122
01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:27.910
Dennis Kelleher: sleep. Gym.

1123
01:40:31.730 --> 01:40:36.370
Dennis Kelleher: How long process is it is it really depends on the size of the customer they get, you know.

1124
01:40:36.690 --> 01:40:41.319
Dennis Kelleher: permitting everything like that in towns. It takes time, yeah.

1125
01:40:41.450 --> 01:40:43.119
Dennis Kelleher: Can take them 6 months to do one.

1126
01:40:44.060 --> 01:40:53.463
Lea Howland: Do we think there's anything we can do, or any information we can provide to shorten that time? Or is it just part of the business that it. It's always gonna take that long

1127
01:40:53.820 --> 01:40:58.329
Dennis Kelleher: Part of the due process of the book which is part of the educate, the awareness and education

1128
01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:02.120
Dennis Kelleher: while connecting them. So I don't know if that's gonna change it.

1129
01:41:04.230 --> 01:41:11.569
Dennis Kelleher: If if we could have a I mean, I know we're just starting. We haven't built it. We're building it now. I'm sure it'll be looking just like what we have today.

1130
01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:13.750
Dennis Kelleher: But if we can.

1131
01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:21.530
Dennis Kelleher: the path, if we can shrink down the path to purchase in any way we need to figure out what that might look like.

1132
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:24.200
Dennis Kelleher: meaning how to measure it.

1133
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:29.469
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah, I mean, maybe it is shrinking down our path to purchase as a success that we can identify.

1134
01:41:32.330 --> 01:41:35.919
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah. As I say, how you're really just sending a lead over is all we're doing. We're

1135
01:41:36.210 --> 01:41:42.290
Dennis Kelleher: I'm I'm I'm opening that up. But are we providing it more enough content on here

1136
01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:47.529
Dennis Kelleher: to create the viability to push the sale a little faster? Yeah.

1137
01:41:47.530 --> 01:41:47.830
Lea Howland: Sure.

1138
01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:48.640
Dennis Kelleher: Okay.

1139
01:41:48.860 --> 01:41:49.440
Dennis Kelleher: I get it.

1140
01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:54.670
Lea Howland: Is there a curtain, a a curtain? Is there a curtain current way to track?

1141
01:41:54.710 --> 01:42:00.170
Lea Howland: How long the purchase takes? Or is it more of just a guess like, is there any type of.

1142
01:42:00.890 --> 01:42:02.010
Dennis Kelleher: There's a lot of. There's a lot of.

1143
01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:24.570
Dennis Kelleher: There's a lot of lot of variables because you have to get permitting, and that could be the town. You have to go before the town board, so there's a lot of different things that you have to do to do it. That's not necessarily you didn't make the sale, but in order to get the full thing going in the 1st gallon in well, I guess the question is, is our job for making the gallons, or is our job, for if they're going in front of permitting, they've already signed with us. Yeah, yeah, usually

1144
01:42:25.050 --> 01:42:48.070
Dennis Kelleher: we're not going to go on permanent. But if they don't get the permit, then you can't do anything. You know you've lost the sales. What I'm saying. Yeah, but that's that's what isn't our job to drive the leads and connect them. Yes, it is. That's so. It's not a real job, whereas increased gallons is great. But that's a further down the line, right? That's a second. But we can see the productivity of the lead right? Right? That's what we want. Yeah, we can track down the back end.

1145
01:42:54.070 --> 01:43:21.450
Lea Howland: So rather than having it being like a measurable goal towards us. It's more of like, Hey, we're supporting the business to be able to increase the gallons, because what we're doing at the top of the funnel is going to help them. Obviously close the deals later on, and in in my mind a way we can even measure. This is like, how long did it take a purchase to take before the new site launch versus post site launch. Is there any way we can measure? Maybe shrinking that path to purchase? It might be something that isn't doable. But is there a way that

1146
01:43:21.470 --> 01:43:30.300
Lea Howland: by how we've showcased the content on the website, or how we're able to help them navigate. You know. Is there a way to measure it? In some

1147
01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:32.419
Lea Howland: case, you know, even if it's like within.

1148
01:43:32.420 --> 01:43:36.970
Dennis Kelleher: Either measurement or it's anecdotal at this point until we have a baseline.

1149
01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:42.489
Dennis Kelleher: And I have to assume so many of these are, they're all unique.

1150
01:43:42.570 --> 01:43:54.659
Dennis Kelleher: Well, yeah, he said, yeah. And the selling point is going to be unique on it, right? It's hard to say if we're going to capture all of those selling points. So it's like, that's why I keep coming back to just the lead. I think it is lead. Gen.

1151
01:43:55.990 --> 01:44:04.909
Dennis Kelleher: We could see the effect of it later. But if we're capturing that information, can then we use that information to say push it out to them for referral.

1152
01:44:05.150 --> 01:44:12.290
Dennis Kelleher: and they get a lead, I mean could be. That might be up to the sales, Guy, to do that, too, though right? I mean he still has the direct contact. He may be one asking for the lead.

1153
01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:36.736
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah. But yeah, I'm not. Gonna Joe Schmo, be the email sender of something. It's gotta come through the systems. Say, Okay, we know we brought this consumer with this business on. We know this closed right? 3 months after it's been installed. They've experienced. Hey? Tell us about your experience. We push it out to them. If you know, if you could do a referral, we can give you a referral of $2,500. I don't know. I'm just.

1154
01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:46.169
Dennis Kelleher: I get concerned about leaving it up. No, I know what you're saying to a guy that may or may not be here.

1155
01:44:46.270 --> 01:45:12.949
Dennis Kelleher: I mean, reality. Sales guys turn. We need to own it. So it's not saying more from a conversion standpoint. Is that what you're going for? Getting more leads. Yeah, I think it's more of like once we've already sold. Once the sales guys already sold them. We have a automation that goes out to them. You know that says, Hey, after 3 months we send them an email because we know they're in the system and say, Hey, you know, how is your experience? Been with halfners.

1156
01:45:13.090 --> 01:45:28.610
Dennis Kelleher: you know. Give us a review, and then, you know, and if you can refer somebody, we'll give you $2,500 off your next purchase, whatever it might be captured on this site of refer somebody you get it, for, you know whatever referral program up here as well. 3 months. Right? Yeah.

1157
01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:33.099
Lea Howland: So that leads us, then.

1158
01:45:33.100 --> 01:45:35.669
Dennis Kelleher: Specific database we need to capture right

1159
01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:44.339
Dennis Kelleher: scrap from their Crm back in their Crm, well, it's gonna have to connect. It's not from they are, they have to all connect

1160
01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:48.940
Dennis Kelleher: as a requirement. Well, if they want

1161
01:45:48.970 --> 01:45:51.672
Dennis Kelleher: the marketing team to drive it, it does.

1162
01:45:56.470 --> 01:46:00.220
Lea Howland: So we can almost do the inverse of

1163
01:46:01.010 --> 01:46:11.090
Lea Howland: what we've listed. As the success. So almost saying, decrease qualified leads increased calls over form fills. Maybe. If that's the the ideal path we want them to take.

1164
01:46:11.768 --> 01:46:13.502
Lea Howland: I would say.

1165
01:46:14.970 --> 01:46:15.870
Lea Howland: you know.

1166
01:46:16.150 --> 01:46:17.170
Lea Howland: lack

1167
01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:25.239
Lea Howland: lack of consideration before calling. Maybe if we're not showcasing the educational materials in a clear manner.

1168
01:46:25.716 --> 01:46:31.003
Lea Howland: or if they're unable to successfully evaluate what their needs before calling in

1169
01:46:31.970 --> 01:46:32.690
Lea Howland: so

1170
01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:33.880
Lea Howland: lack of

1171
01:46:36.070 --> 01:46:36.760
Lea Howland: confirmed

1172
01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:40.080
Lea Howland: calls to customer service.

1173
01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:42.860
Dennis Kelleher: I could learn.

1174
01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:44.839
Lea Howland: Past, your knowledge.

1175
01:46:46.380 --> 01:46:48.550
Dennis Kelleher: Are you saying that because we're not.

1176
01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:55.349
Dennis Kelleher: we're not doing a good job of providing the the right appropriate information.

1177
01:46:56.080 --> 01:47:14.390
Lea Howland: Yeah. So the way I envision it is, however, we decide to design this out obviously, is going to be brand new for these users, and how they self either how they self identify to get the information they need, how we portray that information in the navigation, however it might end up being because we have to start somewhere.

1178
01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:28.369
Lea Howland: And so kind of being able to understand is what we did. The right thing is our people able to find the information and say they need agriculture, information over industrial. Are we helping them in an easy way to get to that information?

1179
01:47:28.653 --> 01:47:44.229
Lea Howland: And kind of just, you know, self. Check ourselves, being like, all right. Yes, this is working versus. Oh, we're getting more people to call in, and because they can't understand how to use the site anymore, or they aren't able to find the information that they need ideally. Obviously, within launch. You know.

1180
01:47:44.460 --> 01:48:07.900
Lea Howland: we're gonna have it. We're gonna be able to test this and say, like, All right, like, what's working, what's not working? But I would say, a failure here, you know, with what we do design, which is going to be wonderful because you've got Ralph and Brianna on the team, and they are amazing. But if people are calling in and saying, Hey, we just can't find the information. Then we've done something wrong. So that's kind of what I would consider a failure here for this journey.

1181
01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:13.149
Dennis Kelleher: Is, did, how did we indic what did we call this category up top.

1182
01:48:13.963 --> 01:48:14.510
Lea Howland: This is.

1183
01:48:14.510 --> 01:48:15.510
Dennis Kelleher: Commercial.

1184
01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:18.750
Lea Howland: Yeah, it's just pretty much evaluating offerings.

1185
01:48:20.650 --> 01:48:23.669
Lea Howland: So they're looking to understand, what are your delivery services?

1186
01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:26.049
Lea Howland: What are the field types, etc?

1187
01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:31.590
Dennis Kelleher: Cause we're gonna have to. I mean, the content on this goes wide.

1188
01:48:31.660 --> 01:48:40.959
Dennis Kelleher: It's it's essentially all the stuff that we talked about this monitoring propane. And then it's every other distillette. Right? Well, yeah. So that's yeah. We talked about that this morning kind of having almost like a

1189
01:48:41.050 --> 01:48:55.589
Dennis Kelleher: a separate page for the distillate part of it. Right? It'll just mirror the the propane design and visually. But it's just another product, right? Some different content. Just make sure they know versus what we I mean, we like, kind of have those little squares today of everything we do. Yeah, yeah.

1190
01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:57.190
Dennis Kelleher: you like this? No.

1191
01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:01.170
Dennis Kelleher: no, I do not. If I have to look at that blue flame anymore.

1192
01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:06.872
Dennis Kelleher: even though it looks like a natural gas. That's okay.

1193
01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:08.730
Dennis Kelleher: Blue Flame.

1194
01:49:08.910 --> 01:49:09.540
Dennis Kelleher: I just.

1195
01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:09.810
Lea Howland: So

1196
01:49:10.170 --> 01:49:10.629
Lea Howland: it's an.

1197
01:49:10.630 --> 01:49:12.339
Dennis Kelleher: Next step here, yep.

1198
01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:19.566
Lea Howland: Which we've already talked about a bit is that they fill out a form which would be new, or they call in

1199
01:49:20.130 --> 01:49:31.430
Lea Howland: I miss. I think that's probably it for this commercial group. There's not like another step we want them to take. Obviously we want them to contact and become be considered as a qualified lead.

1200
01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:35.880
Dennis Kelleher: I think that yeah, making sure that they're directed to their right

1201
01:49:36.540 --> 01:49:40.849
Dennis Kelleher: salesman right? Exactly.

1202
01:49:42.350 --> 01:49:43.350
Lea Howland: And so how we.

1203
01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:52.719
BreAnn Kopcza: Sorry. Can I? Can I clarify? Do you? Do you? Does your team ideally want to show individual people or

1204
01:49:53.070 --> 01:49:58.440
BreAnn Kopcza: teams like in terms of like contacting the right people? Or is it more just?

1205
01:49:59.106 --> 01:50:04.150
BreAnn Kopcza: Filling out information on a form? And then they get directed to the right person like automatically.

1206
01:50:04.150 --> 01:50:04.660
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah.

1207
01:50:04.770 --> 01:50:05.459
BreAnn Kopcza: Okay, hold on.

1208
01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:14.809
Dennis Kelleher: I kind of want to get away with from all the pictures we have of. Here's your person, da da, da, and it because that should be rotating it. It'll rotate, it'll grow whatever.

1209
01:50:15.330 --> 01:50:19.700
Dennis Kelleher: But based on their zip code, it should identify what sales

1210
01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:23.009
Dennis Kelleher: person they would get. Yeah.

1211
01:50:24.723 --> 01:50:35.339
Dennis Kelleher: we could also do that feedback of Thank you. Based on your information. You should be hearing from Mike or Joe. But to your point. If you're putting it on the site. It's almost like

1212
01:50:35.570 --> 01:50:38.799
Dennis Kelleher: it makes us look smaller. Makes us look really small. Yeah.

1213
01:50:39.328 --> 01:50:45.870
Dennis Kelleher: thought of that earlier. But I didn't. Actually, that's a good point. Yeah, like it. Just

1214
01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:50.240
Dennis Kelleher: we're bigger than that. We're family. Yeah, if I need to change that, though.

1215
01:50:51.140 --> 01:51:08.600
Dennis Kelleher: I I completely, because we had it kind of on there right now is if it's on there right now, because it's on there for everybody right now. It's fine. Future state is like, my hope is that we're going to be adding more salespeople. And there's multiple people. So we can't just put one on the

1216
01:51:09.532 --> 01:51:17.270
Dennis Kelleher: family. But I feel like that's too full. It just it. Just it makes us look smaller. It makes us look really small. Yeah.

1217
01:51:18.930 --> 01:51:19.619
Dennis Kelleher: And we're not.

1218
01:51:20.940 --> 01:51:22.980
Dennis Kelleher: We are, but not that small.

1219
01:51:24.710 --> 01:51:25.739
Dennis Kelleher: You need to do.

1220
01:51:26.430 --> 01:51:34.940
Lea Howland: So to actually track this, I'm gonna say, page completions calls to customer service page. I would say, the

1221
01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:39.339
Lea Howland: commercial section engagement, commercial

1222
01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:42.920
Lea Howland: content engagement.

1223
01:51:45.420 --> 01:51:47.440
Dennis Kelleher: From scratch.

1224
01:51:47.810 --> 01:51:50.079
Lea Howland: Is there any type of.

1225
01:51:50.150 --> 01:51:51.390
Lea Howland: I guess

1226
01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:57.947
Lea Howland: email sign up need here as well? I would assume. That's probably an easy win.

1227
01:51:58.350 --> 01:52:01.140
Dennis Kelleher: Yes, it's across the board. You got it.

1228
01:52:03.110 --> 01:52:03.850
Dennis Kelleher: This.

1229
01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:06.000
Lea Howland: And then

1230
01:52:07.100 --> 01:52:12.809
Lea Howland: maybe social, to see any test type of testimonials or reviews.

1231
01:52:13.590 --> 01:52:15.939
Dennis Kelleher: Reviews take those sure. Why not?

1232
01:52:16.090 --> 01:52:17.260
Dennis Kelleher: Clothes are good.

1233
01:52:21.330 --> 01:52:22.400
Dennis Kelleher: anything.

1234
01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:23.920
Lea Howland: I've missed from.

1235
01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:27.149
Dennis Kelleher: It's okay. We'll take it 6 months later.

1236
01:52:28.349 --> 01:52:32.309
Dennis Kelleher: No, I think, until we look at it all in solace.

1237
01:52:33.820 --> 01:52:34.480
Lea Howland: Yep.

1238
01:52:35.290 --> 01:52:40.019
Lea Howland: Well, thank you guys for letting me talk for 2 h. And.

1239
01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:41.869
Dennis Kelleher: Have you done this in 1 h

1240
01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:42.999
Dennis Kelleher: you've got?

1241
01:52:43.050 --> 01:52:45.090
Dennis Kelleher: Did this in an hour before. That's correct.

1242
01:52:45.915 --> 01:52:46.740
Lea Howland: No.

1243
01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:49.832
Jessi Davidson: Probably depends on how many you have up at the top, too.

1244
01:52:50.570 --> 01:52:51.636
Dennis Kelleher: Yeah, we're missing a bucket.

1245
01:52:52.770 --> 01:52:54.889
Lea Howland: Yeah. And we have one that we haven't gone through.

1246
01:52:55.180 --> 01:52:55.930
Dennis Kelleher: We can do that.

1247
01:52:56.380 --> 01:52:59.157
Dennis Kelleher: Swear it's in the scope of work. I swear to God

1248
01:52:59.570 --> 01:53:00.570
Dennis Kelleher: it yeah.

1249
01:53:00.570 --> 01:53:13.549
Lea Howland: We've definitely talked about it to some extent. And what what Bree and I can do is take that offline. Put it together. And I can add this, and maybe we send it over for some homework. If you guys want to fill out this last journey. Now that you guys.

1250
01:53:15.310 --> 01:53:16.110
Lea Howland: okay, and also.

1251
01:53:16.110 --> 01:53:16.650
Jessi Davidson: And I'll.

1252
01:53:16.650 --> 01:53:18.300
Dennis Kelleher: It won't. It won't be that deep.

1253
01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:19.819
Jessi Davidson: I'll send you the.

1254
01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:20.380
Dennis Kelleher: Probably thinks.

1255
01:53:20.380 --> 01:53:25.129
Jessi Davidson: The lucid board. So you have it just for reference as well.

1256
01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:31.390
Jessi Davidson: I'm gonna hit stop recording because I'm gonna talk about scheduling things.
